# Titus 1

[[Titus]] | [[Titus 2]]

---

### 1
Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ in service of the faith of God's elect and of their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,

### 2
in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began.

### 3
In His own time, He has revealed His message in the proclamation entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.

### 4
To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

### 5
The reason I left you in Crete was that you would set in order what was unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.

### 6
An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, having children who are believers and are not open to accusation of indiscretion or insubordination.

### 7
As God's steward, an overseer must be above reproach—not self-absorbed, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not greedy for money.

### 8
Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.

### 9
He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it was taught, so that by sound teaching he will be able to encourage others and refute those who contradict this message.

### 10
For many are rebellious and full of empty talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision,

### 11
who must be silenced. For the sake of dishonorable gain, they undermine entire households and teach things they should not.

### 12
As one of their own prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."

### 13
This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sternly, so that they will be sound in the faith

### 14
and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who have rejected the truth.

### 15
To the pure, all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Indeed, both their minds and their consciences are defiled.

### 16
They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.
