### 1
This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah when he wrote these words on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:

### 2
"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:

### 3
You have said, 'Woe is me, because the LORD has added sorrow to my pain! I am worn out with groaning and have found no rest.'"

### 4
Thus Jeremiah was to say to Baruch: "This is what the LORD says: I will demolish what I have built and uproot what I have planted, throughout the land!

### 5
But as for you, do you seek great things for yourself? Stop seeking! For I will bring disaster on every living creature, declares the LORD, but wherever you go I will grant your life as plunder."
