# 2 Chronicles 17

[[2 Chronicles 16]] | [[2 Chronicles]] | [[2 Chronicles 18]]

### 1
Asa's son Jehoshaphat became king in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel.

### 2
He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.

### 3
Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek out the Baals,

### 4
but he sought the God of his father and walked by His commandments rather than the practices of Israel.

### 5
So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and honor.

### 6
And his heart took delight in the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.

### 7
In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah,

### 8
accompanied by certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram.

### 9
They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people.

### 10
And the dread of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.

### 11
Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him flocks of 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats.

### 12
Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah

### 13
and kept a large amount of supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had fighting men, mighty warriors, in Jerusalem.

### 14
These are their numbers according to the houses of their fathers: For Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander and 300,000 mighty warriors with him;

### 15
next to him, Jehohanan the commander and 280,000 with him;

### 16
next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer for the LORD, and 200,000 mighty warriors with him;

### 17
from Benjamin, Eliada, a mighty warrior, and 200,000 with him armed with bows and shields;

### 18
and next to him, Jehozabad and 180,000 with him equipped for war.

### 19
These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
