# Job 7

[[Job 6]] | [[Job]] | [[Job 8]]

---

### 1
Is not man consigned to labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired hand?

### 2
Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hired man he waits for his wages.

### 3
So I am allotted months of futility, and nights of misery are appointed me.

### 4
When I lie down I think: 'When will I get up?' But the night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.

### 5
My flesh is clothed with worms and encrusted with dirt; my skin is cracked and festering.

### 6
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle; they come to an end without hope.

### 7
Remember that my life is but a breath. My eyes will never again see happiness.

### 8
The eye that beholds me will no longer see me. You will look for me, but I will be no more.

### 9
As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to Sheol will never rise again.

### 10
He will never return to his house; his place will remember him no more.

### 11
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

### 12
Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that You must keep me under guard?

### 13
When I think my bed will comfort me, and my couch will ease my complaint,

### 14
then You frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions,

### 15
so that I would prefer strangling and death over my life in this body.

### 16
I loathe my life! I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.

### 17
What is man that You should exalt him, that You should set Your heart upon him,

### 18
that You attend to him every morning, and test him every moment?

### 19
Will You never look away from me, or let me alone to swallow my spittle?

### 20
If I have sinned, what have I done to You, O Watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, so that I am a burden to You?

### 21
Why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For soon I will lie down in the dust; You will seek me, but I will be no more."
