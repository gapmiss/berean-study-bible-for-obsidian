# Job 22

[[Job 21]] | [[Job]] | [[Job 23]]

### 1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:

### 2
"Can a man be of use to God? Can even a wise man benefit Him?

### 3
Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous? Does He profit if your ways are blameless?

### 4
Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you and enters into judgment against you?

### 5
Is not your wickedness great? Are not your iniquities endless?

### 6
For you demanded security from your brothers without cause, stripping off their clothes and leaving them naked.

### 7
You gave no water to the weary and withheld food from the famished,

### 8
while the land belonged to a mighty man, and a man of honor lived on it.

### 9
You sent widows away empty-handed, and the strength of the fatherless was crushed.

### 10
Therefore snares surround you, and sudden peril terrifies you;

### 11
it is so dark you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you.

### 12
Is not God as high as the heavens? Look at the highest stars, how lofty they are!

### 13
Yet you say: 'What does God know? Does He judge through thick darkness?

### 14
Clouds veil Him so that He cannot see, as He traverses heaven's horizon.'

### 15
Will you stay on the ancient path that wicked men have trod?

### 16
They were snatched away before their time, and their foundations were swept away by a river.

### 17
They said to God, 'Depart from us. What can the Almighty do to us?'

### 18
But it was He who filled their houses with good things; so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.

### 19
The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent mock them, saying,

### 20
'Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire has consumed their excess.'

### 21
Reconcile now and be at peace with Him; thereby good will come to you.

### 22
Receive instruction from His mouth, and lay up His words in your heart.

### 23
If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored. If you remove injustice from your tents

### 24
and consign your gold to the dust and the gold of Ophir to the stones of the ravines,

### 25
then the Almighty will be your gold and the finest silver for you.

### 26
Surely then you will delight in the Almighty and lift up your face to God.

### 27
You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.

### 28
Your decisions will be carried out, and light will shine on your ways.

### 29
When men are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up,' then He will save the lowly.

### 30
He will deliver even the guilty one, who will be rescued through the purity of your hands."
