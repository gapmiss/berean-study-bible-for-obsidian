# Job 26

[[Job 25]] | [[Job]] | [[Job 27]]

### 1
Then Job answered:

### 2
"How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble!

### 3
How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight!

### 4
To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you?

### 5
The dead trembleâ€”those who dwell beneath the waters.

### 6
Sheol is naked before Him, and Abaddon has no covering.

### 7
He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing.

### 8
He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.

### 9
He covers the face of the full moon, spreading His cloud over it.

### 10
He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.

### 11
The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke.

### 12
By His power He stilled the sea, and by His understanding He shattered Rahab.

### 13
By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.

### 14
Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?"
