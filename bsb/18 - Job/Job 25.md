# Job 25

### 1
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:

### 2
"Dominion and awe belong to Him; He establishes harmony in the heights of heaven.

### 3
Can His troops be numbered? On whom does His light not rise?

### 4
How then can a man be just before God? How can one born of woman be pure?

### 5
If even the moon does not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight,

### 6
how much less man, who is but a maggot, and the son of man, who is but a worm!"
