# Job 33

[[Job 32]] | [[Job]] | [[Job 34]]

### 1
But now, Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.

### 2
Behold now, I will open my mouth; what I speak is on the tip of my tongue.

### 3
My words are from an upright heart, and my lips speak sincerely what I know.

### 4
The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

### 5
Refute me if you can; prepare your case and confront me.

### 6
I am just like you before God; I was also formed out of clay.

### 7
Surely no fear of me should terrify you; nor will my hand be heavy upon you.

### 8
Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:

### 9
'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, with no iniquity in me.

### 10
Yet He finds occasions against me; He counts me as His enemy.

### 11
He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches over all my paths.'

### 12
Behold, you are not right in this matter. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.

### 13
Why do you contend with Him that He answers nothing a man asks?

### 14
For God speaks in one way and in another, yet no one notices.

### 15
In a dream, in a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds,

### 16
He opens their ears at that time and terrifies them with warnings,

### 17
in order to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,

### 18
to preserve his soul from the Pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.

### 19
A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,

### 20
so that he detests his bread, and his soul loathes his favorite food.

### 21
His flesh wastes away from sight, and his hidden bones protrude.

### 22
He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the messengers of death.

### 23
Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,

### 24
to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found his ransom,'

### 25
then his flesh will be renewed like a child's, and he will return to the days of his youth.

### 26
He will pray to God and find favor; he will see His face and shout for joy, and God will restore the righteousness of that man.

### 27
Then he will sing before men with these words: 'I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.

### 28
He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will live to see the light.'

### 29
Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times,

### 30
to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of life.

### 31
Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.

### 32
But if you have something to say, answer me; speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.

### 33
But if not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom."
