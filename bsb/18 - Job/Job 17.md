# Job 17

[[Job 16]] | [[Job]] | [[Job 18]]

---

### 1
My spirit is broken; my days are extinguished; the grave awaits me.

### 2
Surely mockers surround me and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.

### 3
Give me, I pray, the pledge You demand. Who else will be my guarantor?

### 4
You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore You will not exalt them.

### 5
If a man denounces his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail.

### 6
He has made me a byword to the people; I am the one in whose face they spit.

### 7
My eyes have grown dim with grief, and my whole body is but a shadow.

### 8
The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are stirred against the godless.

### 9
Yet the righteous will hold to his way, and the one with clean hands will grow stronger.

### 10
But come back and try again, all of you. For I will not find a wise man among you.

### 11
My days have passed; my plans are broken offâ€”even the desires of my heart.

### 12
They have turned night into day and have made light seem near in the face of darkness.

### 13
If I look for Sheol as my home, if I spread out my bed in darkness,

### 14
and say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,'

### 15
where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?

### 16
Will it go down to the gates of Sheol? Will we go down together into the dust?"
