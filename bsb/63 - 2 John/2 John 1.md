# 2 John 1

[[2 John]]

---

### 1
The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I alone, but also all who know the truth—

### 2
because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:

### 3
Grace, mercy, and peace be with us in truth and love from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father.

### 4
I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us.

### 5
And now I urge you, dear lady—not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.

### 6
And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you must walk in love.

### 7
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.

### 8
Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, that you may be fully rewarded.

### 9
Anyone who runs ahead without remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in His teaching has both the Father and the Son.

### 10
If anyone comes to you but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him.

### 11
Whoever greets such a person shares in his evil deeds.

### 12
I have many things to write you, but I would prefer not to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come and speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.

### 13
The children of your elect sister send you greetings.
