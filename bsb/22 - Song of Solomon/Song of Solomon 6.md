### 1
Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Which way has he turned? We will seek him with you.

### 2
My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

### 3
I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me; he pastures his flock among the lilies.

### 4
You are beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, majestic as an army with banners.

### 5
Turn your eyes away from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead.

### 6
Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing; each has its twin, and not one is lost.

### 7
Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.

### 8
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number,

### 9
but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the favorite of the mother who bore her. The maidens see her and call her blessed; the queens and concubines sing her praises.

### 10
Who is this who shines like the dawn, as fair as the moon, as bright as the sun, as majestic as the stars in procession?

### 11
I went down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines were budding, or the pomegranates in bloom.

### 12
Before I realized it, my desire had set me among the chariots of my noble people.

### 13
Come back, come back, O Shulammite! Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you. The Groom Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim?
