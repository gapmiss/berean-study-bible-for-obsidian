### 1
On my bed at night I sought the one I love; I sought him but did not find him.

### 2
I will arise now and go about the city, through the streets and squares. I will seek the one I love. So I sought him but did not find him.

### 3
I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city: "Have you seen the one I love?"

### 4
I had just passed them when I found the one I love. I held him and would not let go until I had brought him to my mother's house, to the chamber of the one who conceived me.

### 5
O daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.

### 6
Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, scented with myrrh and frankincense from all the spices of the merchant?

### 7
Behold, it is Solomon's carriage, escorted by sixty warriors from the valiant of Israel.

### 8
All are skilled with the sword, experienced in warfare. Each has his sword at his side prepared for the terror of night.

### 9
King Solomon has made his carriage out of the timber of Lebanon.

### 10
He has made its posts of silver, its base of gold, its seat of purple fabric. Its interior is inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.

### 11
Come out, O daughters of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, wearing the crown his mother bestowed on the day of his wedding—the day of his heart's rejoicing.
