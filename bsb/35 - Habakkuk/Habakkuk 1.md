# Habakkuk 1

[[Habakkuk]] | [[Habakkuk 2]]

### 1
This is the oracle that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision:

### 2
How long, O LORD, must I call for help but You do not hear, or cry out to You, "Violence!" but You do not save?

### 3
Why do You make me see iniquity? Why do You tolerate wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are before me. Strife is ongoing, and conflict abounds.

### 4
Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked hem in the righteous; therefore, justice is perverted.

### 5
Look at the nations and observe—be utterly astounded! For I am doing a work in your days that you would never believe even if you were told.

### 6
For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans—that ruthless and impetuous nation that marches through the breadth of the earth to seize dwelling places not their own.

### 7
They are dreaded and feared; their justice and sovereignty proceed from themselves.

### 8
Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves of the night. Their horsemen charge ahead, and their cavalry comes from afar. They fly like a vulture, swooping down to devour.

### 9
All of them come bent on violence; their hordes advance like the east wind; they gather prisoners like sand.

### 10
They scoff at kings and make rulers an object of scorn. They laugh at every fortress and build up siege ramps to seize it.

### 11
Then they sweep by like the wind and pass on through. They are guilty; their own strength is their god.

### 12
Are You not from everlasting, O LORD, my God, my Holy One? We will not die. O LORD, You have appointed them to execute judgment; O Rock, You have established them for correction.

### 13
Your eyes are too pure to look on evil, and You cannot tolerate wrongdoing. So why do You tolerate the faithless? Why are You silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?

### 14
You have made men like the fish of the sea, like sea creatures with no ruler.

### 15
The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook; they catch them in their dragnet, and gather them in their fishing net; so they are glad and rejoice.

### 16
Therefore they sacrifice to their dragnet and burn incense to their fishing net, for by these things their portion is sumptuous and their food is rich.

### 17
Will they, therefore, empty their net and continue to slay nations without mercy?
