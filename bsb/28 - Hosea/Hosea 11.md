# Hosea 11

[[Hosea 10]] | [[Hosea]] | [[Hosea 12]]

### 1
When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.

### 2
But the more I called them, the farther they departed from Me. They sacrificed to the Baals and burned incense to carved images.

### 3
It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them in My arms, but they never realized that it was I who healed them.

### 4
I led them with cords of kindness, with ropes of love; I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.

### 5
Will they not return to the land of Egypt and be ruled by Assyria because they refused to repent?

### 6
A sword will whirl through their cities; it will destroy the bars of their gates and consume them in their own plans.

### 7
My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to the Most High, He will by no means exalt them.

### 8
How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within Me; My compassion is stirred!

### 9
I will not execute the full fury of My anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man—the Holy One among you—and I will not come in wrath.

### 10
They will walk after the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.

### 11
They will come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes, declares the LORD.

### 12
Ephraim surrounds me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.
