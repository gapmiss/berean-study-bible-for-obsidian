# Hosea 12

[[Hosea 11]] | [[Hosea]] | [[Hosea 13]]

### 1
Ephraim chases the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; he multiplies lies and violence; he makes a covenant with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt.

### 2
The LORD also brings a charge against Judah. He will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.

### 3
In the womb he grasped his brother's heel, and in his vigor he wrestled with God.

### 4
Yes, he struggled with the Angel and prevailed; he wept and sought His favor; he found Him at Bethel, and there He spoke with us—

### 5
the LORD is the God of Hosts—the LORD is His name of renown.

### 6
But you must return to your God, maintaining love and justice, and always waiting on your God.

### 7
A merchant loves to defraud with dishonest scales in his hands.

### 8
And Ephraim boasts: "How rich I have become; I have found wealth for myself. In all my labors, they can find in me no iniquity that is sinful."

### 9
But I am the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt. I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast.

### 10
I spoke through the prophets and multiplied their visions; I gave parables through the prophets.

### 11
Is there iniquity in Gilead? They will surely come to nothing. Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Indeed, their altars will be heaps of stones in the furrows of the field.

### 12
Jacob fled to the land of Aram and Israel worked for a wife—for a wife he tended sheep.

### 13
But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.

### 14
Ephraim has provoked bitter anger, so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt upon him and repay him for his contempt.
