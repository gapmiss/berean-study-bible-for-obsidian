# Ecclesiastes 6

[[Ecclesiastes 5]] | [[Ecclesiastes]] | [[Ecclesiastes 7]]

### 1
There is another evil I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily upon mankind:

### 2
God gives a man riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; but God does not allow him to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger will enjoy them. This is futile and a grievous evil.

### 3
A man may father a hundred children and live for many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he is unsatisfied with his prosperity and does not even receive a proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.

### 4
For he enters in futility and departs in darkness, and his name is shrouded in obscurity.

### 5
A stillborn child has more rest than he—though never seeing the sun or knowing anything—

### 6
if he lives a thousand years twice over, but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?

### 7
All a man's labor is for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.

### 8
What advantage, then, has the wise man over the fool? What gain comes to the poor man who knows how to conduct himself before others?

### 9
Better what the eye can see than the wandering of desire. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.

### 10
Whatever exists was named long ago, and what happens to a man is foreknown; but he cannot contend with one stronger than he.

### 11
For the more words, the more futility—and how does that profit anyone?

### 12
For who knows what is good for a man during the few days he passes through his fleeting life like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come after him under the sun?
