# Ecclesiastes 4

[[Ecclesiastes 3]] | [[Ecclesiastes]] | [[Ecclesiastes 5]]

---

### 1
Again, I observed all the oppression taking place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; the power lay in the hands of their oppressors, and there was no comforter.

### 2
So I admired the dead, who had already died, above the living, who are still alive.

### 3
But better than both is he who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.

### 4
I saw that all labor and success spring from a man's envy of his neighbor. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.

### 5
The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.

### 6
Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and pursuit of the wind.

### 7
Again, I saw futility under the sun.

### 8
There is a man all alone, without even a son or brother. And though there is no end to his labor, his eyes are still not content with his wealth: "For whom do I toil and bereave my soul of enjoyment?" This too is futileâ€”a miserable task.

### 9
Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.

### 10
For if one falls down, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to help him up!

### 11
Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how can one keep warm alone?

### 12
And though one may be overpowered, two can resist. Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.

### 13
Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take a warning.

### 14
For the youth came from prison to be king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.

### 15
I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed this second child, who succeeded the king.

### 16
There is no limit to all the people who were before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in the successor. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
