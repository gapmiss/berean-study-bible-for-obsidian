### 1
The plans of the heart belong to man, but the reply of the tongue is from the LORD.

### 2
All a man's ways are pure in his own eyes, but his motives are weighed by the LORD.

### 3
Commit your works to the LORD, and your plans will be achieved.

### 4
The LORD has made everything for His purposeâ€”even the wicked for the day of disaster.

### 5
Everyone who is proud in heart is detestable to the LORD; be assured that he will not go unpunished.

### 6
By loving devotion and truth, wickedness is atoned for, and by the fear of the LORD a man turns aside from evil.

### 7
When a man's ways please the LORD, He makes even the man's enemies live at peace with him.

### 8
Better a little with righteousness than great gain with injustice.

### 9
A man's heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.

### 10
A divine verdict is on the lips of a king; his mouth should not betray justice.

### 11
Honest scales and balances are from the LORD; all the weights in the bag are His concern.

### 12
Wicked behavior is detestable to kings, for a throne is established through righteousness.

### 13
Righteous lips are a king's delight, and he who speaks honestly is beloved.

### 14
The wrath of a king is a messenger of death, but a wise man will pacify it.

### 15
When a king's face brightens, there is life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.

### 16
How much better to acquire wisdom than gold; to gain understanding is more desirable than silver.

### 17
The highway of the upright leads away from evil; he who guards his way protects his life.

### 18
Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.

### 19
It is better to be lowly in spirit among the humble than to divide the spoil with the proud.

### 20
Whoever heeds instruction will find success, and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.

### 21
The wise in heart will be called discerning, and pleasant speech increases learning.

### 22
Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessor, but the discipline of fools is folly.

### 23
The heart of the wise man instructs his mouth and adds persuasiveness to his lips.

### 24
Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.

### 25
There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.

### 26
A worker's appetite works for him because his hunger drives him onward.

### 27
A worthless man digs up evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire.

### 28
A perverse man spreads dissension, and a gossip divides close friends.

### 29
A violent man entices his neighbor and leads him down a path that is not good.

### 30
He who winks his eye devises perversity; he who purses his lips is bent on evil.

### 31
Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained along the path of righteousness.

### 32
He who is slow to anger is better than a warrior, and he who controls his temper is greater than one who captures a city.

### 33
The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD.
