# Proverbs 9

[[Proverbs 8]] | [[Proverbs]] | [[Proverbs 10]]

---

### 1
Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars.

### 2
She has prepared her meat; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.

### 3
She has sent out her maidservants; she calls out from the heights of the city:

### 4
"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks judgment she says:

### 5
"Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine I have mixed.

### 6
Leave your folly behind, and you will live; walk in the way of understanding."

### 7
He who corrects a mocker will bring shame on himself; he who rebukes a wicked man will be tainted.

### 8
Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.

### 9
Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.

### 10
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.

### 11
For through wisdom your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.

### 12
If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage; but if you scoff, you alone will bear the consequences.

### 13
The woman named Folly is loud; she is naive and knows nothing.

### 14
She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city,

### 15
calling to those who pass by, who make their paths straight:

### 16
"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks judgment she says:

### 17
"Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is tasty!"

### 18
But they do not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
