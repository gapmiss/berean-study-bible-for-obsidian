### 1
From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God,

### 2
saying: "In my distress I called to the LORD and He answered me. From the belly of Sheol I called for help, and You heard my voice.

### 3
For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the current swirled about me. All Your breakers and waves swept over me.

### 4
At this, I said, 'I have been banished from Your sight; yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.'

### 5
The waters engulfed me up to the neck; the watery depths overcame me; the seaweed wrapped around my head.

### 6
To the roots of the mountains I descended; the earth beneath me barred me in forever! But You raised my life from the pit, O LORD my God!

### 7
As my life was fading away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer went up to You, to Your holy temple.

### 8
Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion.

### 9
But I, with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!"

### 10
And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
