# Psalms 9

[[Psalms 8]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 10]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. To the tune of "The Death of the Son." A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonders.

### 2
I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.

### 3
When my enemies retreat, they stumble and perish before You.

### 4
For You have upheld my just cause; You sit on Your throne judging righteously.

### 5
You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; You have erased their name forever and ever.

### 6
The enemy has come to eternal ruin, and You have uprooted their cities; the very memory of them has vanished.

### 7
But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment.

### 8
He judges the world with justice; He will govern the people with equity.

### 9
The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.

### 10
Those who know Your name will trust in You, for You, O LORD, have not abandoned those who seek You.

### 11
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; proclaim His deeds among the nations.

### 12
For the Avenger of bloodshed remembers; He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.

### 13
Be merciful to me, O LORD; see how my enemies afflict me! Snatch me from the gates of death,

### 14
that I may declare all Your praises—that within the gates of Daughter Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.

### 15
The nations have fallen into a pit of their making; their feet are snared in the net they have hidden.

### 16
The LORD is known by the justice He brings; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion Selah

### 17
The wicked will return to Sheol—all the nations who forget God.

### 18
For the needy will not always be forgotten; nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed.

### 19
Rise up, O LORD, let not man prevail; let the nations be judged in Your presence.

### 20
Lay terror upon them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah
