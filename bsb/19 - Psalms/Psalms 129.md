# Psalms 129

[[Psalms 128]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 130]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Many a time they have persecuted me from my youth—let Israel now declare—

### 2
many a time they have persecuted me from my youth, but they have not prevailed against me.

### 3
The plowmen plowed over my back; they made their furrows long.

### 4
The LORD is righteous; He has cut me from the cords of the wicked.

### 5
May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.

### 6
May they be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can grow,

### 7
unable to fill the hands of the reaper, or the arms of the one who binds sheaves.

### 8
May none who pass by say to them, "The blessing of the LORD be on you. We bless you in the name of the LORD."
