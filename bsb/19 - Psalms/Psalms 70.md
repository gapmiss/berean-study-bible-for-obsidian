# Psalms 70

[[Psalms 69]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 71]]

---

### 1
For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me! Hurry, O LORD, to help me!

### 2
May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated.

### 3
May those who say, "Aha, aha!" retreat because of their shame.

### 4
May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation ever say, "Let God be magnified!"

### 5
I am poor and needy; hurry to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
