# Psalms 33

[[Psalms 32]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 34]]

### 1
Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous; befitting is the praise of the upright.

### 2
Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to Him with ten strings.

### 3
Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with a shout of joy.

### 4
For the word of the LORD is upright, and all His work is trustworthy.

### 5
The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of His loving devotion.

### 6
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the stars by the breath of His mouth.

### 7
He piles up the waters of the sea; He puts the depths into storehouses.

### 8
Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere Him.

### 9
For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.

### 10
The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; He thwarts the devices of the peoples.

### 11
The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the purposes of His heart to all generations.

### 12
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He has chosen as His inheritance!

### 13
The LORD looks down from heaven; He sees all the sons of men.

### 14
From His dwelling place He gazes on all who inhabit the earth.

### 15
He shapes the hearts of each; He considers all their works.

### 16
No king is saved by his vast army; no warrior is delivered by his great strength.

### 17
A horse is a vain hope for salvation; even its great strength cannot save.

### 18
Surely the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him, on those whose hope is in His loving devotion

### 19
to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.

### 20
Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.

### 21
For our hearts rejoice in Him, since we trust in His holy name.

### 22
May Your loving devotion rest on us, O LORD, as we put our hope in You.
