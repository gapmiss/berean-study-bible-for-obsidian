# Psalms 36

[[Psalms 35]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 37]]

---

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD. An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man: There is no fear of God before his eyes.

### 2
For his eyes are too full of conceit to detect or hate his own sin.

### 3
The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and well-doing.

### 4
Even on his bed he plots wickedness; he sets himself on a path that is not good; he does not reject evil.

### 5
Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, Your steadfastness to the clouds.

### 6
Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, Your judgments like the deepest sea. O LORD, You preserve man and beast.

### 7
How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, that the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.

### 8
They feast on the abundance of Your house, and You give them drink from Your river of delights.

### 9
For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light.

### 10
Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.

### 11
Let not the foot of the proud come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.

### 12
There the evildoers lie fallen, thrown down and unable to rise.
