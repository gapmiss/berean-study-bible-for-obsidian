# Psalms 97

[[Psalms 96]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 98]]

### 1
The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the distant shores be glad.

### 2
Clouds and darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are His throne's foundation.

### 3
Fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side.

### 4
His lightning illuminates the world; the earth sees and trembles.

### 5
The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.

### 6
The heavens proclaim His righteousness; all the peoples see His glory.

### 7
All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idolsâ€”worship Him, all you gods!

### 8
Zion hears and rejoices, and the towns of Judah exult because of Your judgments, O LORD.

### 9
For You, O LORD, are Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.

### 10
O you who love the LORD, hate evil! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.

### 11
Light is sown on the righteous, gladness on the upright in heart.

### 12
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones, and praise His holy name.
