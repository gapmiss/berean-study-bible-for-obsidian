# Psalms 115

[[Psalms 114]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 116]]

### 1
Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory, because of Your loving devotion, because of Your faithfulness.

### 2
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"

### 3
Our God is in heaven and does as He pleases.

### 4
Their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.

### 5
They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;

### 6
they have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell;

### 7
they have hands, but cannot feel; they have feet, but cannot walk. They cannot utter a sound with their throats.

### 8
Those who make them will be like them, as will all who trust in them.

### 9
O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.

### 10
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.

### 11
You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.

### 12
The LORD is mindful of us; He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron;

### 13
He will bless those who fear the LORDâ€”small and great alike.

### 14
May the LORD give you increase, both you and your children.

### 15
May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.

### 16
The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth He has given to mankind.

### 17
It is not the dead who praise the LORD, nor any who descend into silence.

### 18
But it is we who will bless the LORD, both now and forevermore. Hallelujah!
