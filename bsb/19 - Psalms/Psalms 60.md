# Psalms 60

[[Psalms 59]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 61]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. To the tune of "The Lily of Testimony." A Miktam of David for instruction. When he fought Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. You have rejected us, O God; You have broken us; You have been angry; restore us!

### 2
You have shaken the land and torn it open. Heal its fractures, for it is quaking.

### 3
You have shown Your people hardship; we are staggered from the wine You made us drink.

### 4
You have raised a banner for those who fear You, that they may flee the bow. Selah

### 5
Save us with Your right hand; answer us, that those You love may be delivered.

### 6
God has spoken from His sanctuary: "I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem and apportion the Valley of Succoth.

### 7
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet and Judah is My scepter.

### 8
Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph."

### 9
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

### 10
Have You not rejected us, O God? Will You not march out with our armies?

### 11
Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.

### 12
With God we will perform with valor; He will trample our enemies.
