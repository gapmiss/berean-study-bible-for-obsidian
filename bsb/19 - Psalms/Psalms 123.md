# Psalms 123

[[Psalms 122]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 124]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. I lift up my eyes to You, the One enthroned in heaven.

### 2
As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidservant look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are on the LORD our God until He shows us mercy.

### 3
Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy, for we have endured much contempt.

### 4
We have endured much scorn from the arrogant, much contempt from the proud.
