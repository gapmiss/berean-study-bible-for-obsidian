# Psalms 133

[[Psalms 132]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 134]]

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is when brothers live in harmony!

### 2
It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron's beard over the collar of his robes.

### 3
It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD has bestowed the blessing of life forevermore.
