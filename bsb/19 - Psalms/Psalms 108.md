# Psalms 108

[[Psalms 107]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 109]]

### 1
A Song. A Psalm of David. My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing and make music with all my being.

### 2
Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.

### 3
I will praise You, O LORD, among the peoples; I will sing Your praises among the nations.

### 4
For Your loving devotion is higher than the heavens, and Your truth reaches to the skies.

### 5
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let Your glory cover the earth.

### 6
That Your beloved may be delivered, save me by Your right hand and answer me!

### 7
God has spoken in His sanctuary: "I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem, and apportion the Valley of Succoth.

### 8
Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet and Judah My scepter.

### 9
Moab is My washbasin; on Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph."

### 10
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

### 11
Have You rejected us, O God? Do You no longer march out, O God, with our armies?

### 12
Give us aid against the foe, for the help of man is worthless.

### 13
With God we perform with valor, and He will trample our enemies.
