### 1
Hallelujah! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the highest places.

### 2
Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His heavenly hosts.

### 3
Praise Him, O sun and moon; praise Him, all you shining stars.

### 4
Praise Him, O highest heavens, and you waters above the skies.

### 5
Let them praise the name of the LORD, for He gave the command and they were created.

### 6
He established them forever and ever; He issued a decree that will never pass away.

### 7
Praise the LORD from the earth, all great sea creatures and ocean depths,

### 8
lightning and hail, snow and clouds, powerful wind fulfilling His word,

### 9
mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,

### 10
wild animals and all cattle, crawling creatures and flying birds,

### 11
kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth,

### 12
young men and maidens, old and young together.

### 13
Let them praise the name of the LORD, for His name alone is exalted; His splendor is above heaven and earth.

### 14
He has raised up a horn for His people, the praise of all His saints, of Israel, a people near to Him. Hallelujah!
