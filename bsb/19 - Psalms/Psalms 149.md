# Psalms 149

[[Psalms 148]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 150]]

### 1
Hallelujah! Sing to the LORD a new song—His praise in the assembly of the godly.

### 2
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.

### 3
Let them praise His name with dancing, and make music to Him with tambourine and harp.

### 4
For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He adorns the afflicted with salvation.

### 5
Let the saints exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds.

### 6
May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands,

### 7
to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,

### 8
to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with shackles of iron,

### 9
to execute the judgment written against them. This honor is for all His saints. Hallelujah!
