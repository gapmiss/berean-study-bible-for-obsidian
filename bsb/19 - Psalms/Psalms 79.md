# Psalms 79

[[Psalms 78]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 80]]

### 1
A Psalm of Asaph. The nations, O God, have invaded Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy temple and reduced Jerusalem to rubble.

### 2
They have given the corpses of Your servants as food to the birds of the air, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.

### 3
They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.

### 4
We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those around us.

### 5
How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?

### 6
Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that refuse to call on Your name,

### 7
for they have devoured Jacob and laid waste to his homeland.

### 8
Do not hold past sins against us; let Your compassion come quickly, for we are brought low.

### 9
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; deliver us and atone for our sins, for the sake of Your name.

### 10
Why should the nations ask, "Where is their God?" Before our eyes, make known among the nations Your vengeance for the bloodshed of Your servants.

### 11
May the groans of the captives reach You; by the strength of Your arm preserve those condemned to death.

### 12
Pay back into the laps of our neighbors sevenfold the reproach they hurled at You, O Lord.

### 13
Then we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will thank You forever; from generation to generation, we will declare Your praise.
