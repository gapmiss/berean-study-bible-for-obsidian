# Psalms 19

[[Psalms 18]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 20]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.

### 2
Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.

### 3
Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard,

### 4
their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun

### 5
like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.

### 6
It rises at one end of the heavens and runs its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.

### 7
The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the simple.

### 8
The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart; the commandments of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.

### 9
The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true, being altogether righteous.

### 10
They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.

### 11
By them indeed Your servant is warned; in keeping them is great reward.

### 12
Who can discern his own errors? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.

### 13
Keep Your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed of great transgression.

### 14
May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.
