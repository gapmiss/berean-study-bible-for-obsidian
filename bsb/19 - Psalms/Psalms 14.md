# Psalms 14

[[Psalms 13]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 15]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. Of David. The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt; their acts are vile. There is no one who does good.

### 2
The LORD looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if any understand, if any seek God.

### 3
All have turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.

### 4
Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread; they refuse to call upon the LORD.

### 5
There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is in the company of the righteous.

### 6
You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed, yet the LORD is their shelter.

### 7
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
