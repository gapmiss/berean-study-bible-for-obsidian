# Psalms 141

[[Psalms 140]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 142]]

### 1
A Psalm of David. I call upon You, O LORD; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to You.

### 2
May my prayer be set before You like incense, my uplifted hands like the evening offering.

### 3
Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.

### 4
Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing or take part in works of wickedness with men who do iniquity; let me not feast on their delicacies.

### 5
Let the righteous man strike me; let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion. It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked.

### 6
When their rulers are thrown from the cliffs, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.

### 7
As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.

### 8
But my eyes are fixed on You, O GOD, the Lord. In You I seek refuge; do not leave my soul defenseless.

### 9
Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the lures of the evildoers.

### 10
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
