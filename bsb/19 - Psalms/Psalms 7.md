# Psalms 7

[[Psalms 6]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 8]]

---

### 1
A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD about Cush, a Benjamite. O LORD my God, I take refuge in You; save me and deliver me from all my pursuers,

### 2
or they will shred my soul like a lion, and tear me to pieces with no one to rescue me.

### 3
O LORD my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands,

### 4
if I have rewarded my ally with evil, if I have plundered my foe without cause,

### 5
then may my enemy pursue and overtake me; may he trample me to the ground and leave my honor in the dust. Selah

### 6
Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; rise up against the fury of my enemies. Awake, my God, and ordain judgment.

### 7
Let the assembled peoples encompass You; take Your seat over them on high.

### 8
The LORD judges the peoples; vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and integrity.

### 9
Put an end to the evil of the wicked, but establish the righteous, O righteous God who searches hearts and minds.

### 10
My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.

### 11
God is a righteous judge and a God who feels indignation each day.

### 12
If one does not repent, God will sharpen His sword; He has bent and strung His bow.

### 13
He has prepared His deadly weapons; He ordains His arrows with fire.

### 14
Behold, the wicked man travails with evil; he conceives trouble and births falsehood.

### 15
He has dug a hole and hollowed it out; he has fallen into the pit of his making.

### 16
His trouble recoils on himself, and his violence falls on his own head.

### 17
I will thank the LORD for His righteousness and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
