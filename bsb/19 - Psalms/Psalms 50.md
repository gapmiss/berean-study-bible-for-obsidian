# Psalms 50

[[Psalms 49]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 51]]

### 1
A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising to the setting of the sun.

### 2
From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.

### 3
Our God comes and will not be silent! Consuming fire precedes Him, and a tempest rages around Him.

### 4
He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that He may judge His people:

### 5
"Gather to Me My saints, who made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."

### 6
And the heavens proclaim His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge. Selah

### 7
"Hear, O My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.

### 8
I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices, and your burnt offerings are ever before Me.

### 9
I have no need for a bull from your stall or goats from your pens,

### 10
for every beast of the forest is Mineâ€”the cattle on a thousand hills.

### 11
I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are Mine.

### 12
If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof.

### 13
Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

### 14
Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and fulfill your vows to the Most High.

### 15
Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor Me."

### 16
To the wicked, however, God says, "What right have you to recite My statutes and to bear My covenant on your lips?

### 17
For you hate My instruction and cast My words behind you.

### 18
When you see a thief, you befriend him, and throw in your lot with adulterers.

### 19
You unleash your mouth for evil and unharness your tongue for deceit.

### 20
You sit and malign your brother, you slander your own mother's son.

### 21
You have done these things, and I kept silent; you thought I was just like you. But I Myself will rebuke you and accuse you to your face.

### 22
Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:

### 23
He who sacrifices a thank offering honors Me, and to him who rights his way, I will show the salvation of God."
