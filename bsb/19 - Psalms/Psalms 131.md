# Psalms 131

[[Psalms 130]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 132]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Of David. My heart is not proud, O LORD, my eyes are not haughty. I do not aspire to great matters or things too lofty for me.

### 2
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.

### 3
O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, both now and forevermore.
