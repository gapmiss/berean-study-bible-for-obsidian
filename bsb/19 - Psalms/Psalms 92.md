# Psalms 92

[[Psalms 91]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 93]]

### 1
A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath day. It is good to praise the LORD, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High,

### 2
to proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning, and Your faithfulness at night,

### 3
with the ten-stringed harp and the melody of the lyre.

### 4
For You, O LORD, have made me glad by Your deeds; I will sing for joy at the works of Your hands.

### 5
How great are Your works, O LORD, how deep are Your thoughts!

### 6
A senseless man does not know, and a fool does not understand,

### 7
that though the wicked sprout like grass, and all evildoers flourish, they will be forever destroyed.

### 8
But You, O LORD, are exalted forever.

### 9
For surely Your enemies, O LORD, surely Your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.

### 10
But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; with fine oil I have been anointed.

### 11
My eyes see the downfall of my enemies; when evildoers attack me, my ears are open.

### 12
The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

### 13
Planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God.

### 14
In old age they will still bear fruit; healthy and green they will remain,

### 15
to proclaim, "The LORD is upright; He is my rock, and in Him there is no unrighteousness."
