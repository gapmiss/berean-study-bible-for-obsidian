# Psalms 28

[[Psalms 27]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 29]]

---

### 1
Of David. To You, O LORD, I call; be not deaf to me, O my rock. For if You remain silent, I will be like those descending to the Pit.

### 2
Hear my cry for mercy when I call to You for help, when I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.

### 3
Do not drag me away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors while malice is in their hearts.

### 4
Repay them according to their deeds, and for their works of evil. Repay them for what their hands have done; bring back on them what they deserve.

### 5
Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD or what His hands have done, He will tear them down and never rebuild them.

### 6
Blessed be the LORD, for He has heard my cry for mercy.

### 7
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in Him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart rejoices, and I will thank Him with my song.

### 8
The LORD is the strength of His people, a stronghold of salvation for His anointed.

### 9
Save Your people and bless Your inheritance; shepherd them and carry them forever.
