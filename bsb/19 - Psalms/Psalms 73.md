### 1
A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.

### 2
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.

### 3
For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

### 4
They have no struggle in their death; their bodies are well-fed.

### 5
They are free of the burdens others carry; they are not afflicted like other men.

### 6
Therefore pride is their necklace; a garment of violence covers them.

### 7
From their callous hearts proceeds iniquity; the imaginations of their hearts run wild.

### 8
They mock and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression.

### 9
They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongues strut across the earth.

### 10
So His people return to this place and drink up waters in abundance.

### 11
The wicked say, "How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?"

### 12
Behold, these are the wickedâ€”always carefree as they increase their wealth.

### 13
Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure; in innocence I have washed my hands.

### 14
For I am afflicted all day long and punished every morning.

### 15
If I had said, "I will speak this way," then I would have betrayed Your children.

### 16
When I tried to understand all this, it was troublesome in my sight

### 17
until I entered God's sanctuary; then I discerned their end.

### 18
Surely You set them on slick ground; You cast them down into ruin.

### 19
How suddenly they are laid waste, completely swept away by terrors!

### 20
Like a dream when one awakens, upon arising, O Lord, You will despise their form.

### 21
When my heart was grieved and I was pierced within,

### 22
I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before You.

### 23
Yet I am always with You; You hold my right hand.

### 24
You guide me with Your counsel, and later receive me in glory.

### 25
Whom have I in heaven but You? And on earth I desire no one besides You.

### 26
My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

### 27
Those far from You will surely perish; You destroy all who are unfaithful to You.

### 28
But as for me, it is good to draw near to God. I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may proclaim all Your works.
