# Psalms 105

[[Psalms 104]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 106]]

### 1
Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name; make known His deeds among the nations.

### 2
Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; tell of all His wonders.

### 3
Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.

### 4
Seek out the LORD and His strength; seek His face always.

### 5
Remember the wonders He has done, His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced,

### 6
O offspring of Abraham His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.

### 7
He is the LORD our God; His judgments carry throughout the earth.

### 8
He remembers His covenant forever, the word He ordained for a thousand generations—

### 9
the covenant He made with Abraham, and the oath He swore to Isaac.

### 10
He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:

### 11
"I will give you the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance."

### 12
When they were few in number, few indeed, and strangers in the land,

### 13
they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.

### 14
He let no man oppress them; He rebuked kings on their behalf:

### 15
"Do not touch My anointed ones; do no harm to My prophets."

### 16
He called down famine on the land and cut off all their supplies of food.

### 17
He sent a man before them—Joseph, sold as a slave.

### 18
They bruised his feet with shackles and placed his neck in irons,

### 19
until his prediction came true, the word of the LORD tested him.

### 20
The king sent and released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.

### 21
He made him master of his household, ruler over all his substance,

### 22
to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.

### 23
Then Israel went to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

### 24
And the LORD made His people very fruitful, more numerous than their foes,

### 25
whose hearts He turned to hate His people, to conspire against His servants.

### 26
He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen.

### 27
They performed His miraculous signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

### 28
He sent darkness, and it became dark—for had they not defied His words?

### 29
He turned their water to blood and caused their fish to die.

### 30
Their land teemed with frogs, even in their royal chambers.

### 31
He spoke, and insects swarmed—gnats throughout their country.

### 32
He gave them hail for rain, with lightning throughout their land.

### 33
He struck their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.

### 34
He spoke, and the locusts came—young locusts without number.

### 35
They devoured every plant in their land and consumed the produce of their soil.

### 36
Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigor.

### 37
Then He brought Israel out with silver and gold, and none among His tribes stumbled.

### 38
Egypt was glad when they departed, for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.

### 39
He spread a cloud as a covering and a fire to light up the night.

### 40
They asked, and He brought quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

### 41
He opened a rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.

### 42
For He remembered His holy promise to Abraham His servant.

### 43
He brought forth His people with rejoicing, His chosen with shouts of joy.

### 44
He gave them the lands of the nations, that they might inherit the fruit of others' labor,

### 45
that they might keep His statutes and observe His laws. Hallelujah!
