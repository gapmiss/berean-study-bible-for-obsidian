# Psalms 127

[[Psalms 126]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 128]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, its builders labor in vain; unless the LORD protects the city, its watchmen stand guard in vain.

### 2
In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for bread to eat—for He gives sleep to His beloved.

### 3
Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD, and the fruit of the womb is His reward.

### 4
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are children born in one's youth.

### 5
Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. He will not be put to shame when he confronts the enemies at the gate.
