# Psalms 4

[[Psalms 3]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 5]]

---

### 1
For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved my distress; show me grace and hear my prayer.

### 2
How long, O men, will my honor be maligned? How long will you love vanity and seek after lies? Selah

### 3
Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself; the LORD will hear when I call to Him.

### 4
Be angry, yet do not sin; on your bed, search your heart and be still. Selah

### 5
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and trust in the LORD.

### 6
Many ask, "Who can show us the good?" Shine the light of Your face upon us, O LORD.

### 7
You have filled my heart with more joy than when grain and new wine abound.

### 8
I will lie down and sleep in peace, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.
