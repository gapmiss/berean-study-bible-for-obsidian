### 1
A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORD's, and the fullness thereof, the world and all who dwell therein.

### 2
For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.

### 3
Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place?

### 4
He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to falsehood, who does not swear deceitfully.

### 5
He shall receive blessing from the LORD, and vindication from the God of his salvation.

### 6
Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face, O God of Jacob. Selah

### 7
Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!

### 8
Who is this King of Glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.

### 9
Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!

### 10
Who is He, this King of Glory? The LORD of Hostsâ€”He is the King of Glory. Selah
