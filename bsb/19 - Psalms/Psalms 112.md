[[Psalms 111]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 113]]

### 1
Hallelujah! Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments.

### 2
His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.

### 3
Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.

### 4
Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, for the one who is gracious, compassionate, and righteous.

### 5
It is well with the man who is generous and lends freely, whose affairs are guided by justice.

### 6
Surely he will never be shaken. The righteous man will be remembered forever.

### 7
He will not fear bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.

### 8
His heart is assured; he will not fear, until he looks in triumph on his foes.

### 9
He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever. His horn will be lifted high in honor.

### 10
The wicked man will see and be grieved; he will gnash his teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked will perish.
