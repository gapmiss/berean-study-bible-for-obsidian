# Psalms 6

[[Psalms 5]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 7]]

---

### 1
For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments, according to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, or discipline me in Your wrath.

### 2
Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am frail; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are in agony.

### 3
My soul is deeply distressed. How long, O LORD, how long?

### 4
Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul; save me because of Your loving devotion.

### 5
For there is no mention of You in death; who can praise You from Sheol?

### 6
I am weary from groaning; all night I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.

### 7
My eyes fail from grief; they grow dim because of all my foes.

### 8
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the LORD has heard my weeping.

### 9
The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.

### 10
All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace.
