# Psalms 48

[[Psalms 47]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 49]]

---

### 1
A Song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, His holy mountain.

### 2
Beautiful in loftiness, the joy of all the earth, like the peaks of Zaphron is Mount Zion, the city of the great King.

### 3
God is in her citadels; He has shown Himself a fortress.

### 4
For behold, the kings assembled; they all advanced together.

### 5
They saw and were astounded; they fled in terror.

### 6
Trembling seized them there, anguish like a woman in labor.

### 7
With a wind from the east You wrecked the ships of Tarshish.

### 8
As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the LORD of Hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish her forever. Selah

### 9
Within Your temple, O God, we contemplate Your loving devotion.

### 10
Your name, O God, like Your praise, reaches to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.

### 11
Mount Zion is glad, the towns of Judah rejoice, on account of Your judgments.

### 12
March around Zion, encircle her, count her towers,

### 13
consider her ramparts, tour her citadels, that you may tell the next generation.

### 14
For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even until death.
