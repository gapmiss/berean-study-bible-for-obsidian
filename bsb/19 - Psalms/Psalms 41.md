# Psalms 41

[[Psalms 40]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 42]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Blessed is he who cares for the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.

### 2
The LORD will protect and preserve him; He will bless him in the land and will not surrender him to the will of his foes.

### 3
The LORD will sustain him on his bed of illness and restore him from his bed of sickness.

### 4
I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against You."

### 5
My enemies say with malice: "When will he die and be forgotten?"

### 6
My visitor speaks falsehood; he gathers slander in his heart; he goes out and spreads it abroad.

### 7
All who hate me whisper against me; they imagine the worst for me:

### 8
"A vile disease has been poured into him; he will never get up from where he lies!"

### 9
Even my close friend, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.

### 10
But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, that I may repay them.

### 11
By this I know You delight in me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.

### 12
In my integrity You uphold me and set me in Your presence forever.

### 13
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
