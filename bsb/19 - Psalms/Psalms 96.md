# Psalms 96

[[Psalms 95]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 97]]

---

### 1
Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.

### 2
Sing to the LORD, praise His name; proclaim His salvation day after day.

### 3
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all peoples.

### 4
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.

### 5
For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the LORD who made the heavens.

### 6
Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty fill His sanctuary.

### 7
Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.

### 8
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and enter His courts.

### 9
Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.

### 10
Declare among the nations: "The LORD reigns." The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved; He judges the peoples with equity.

### 11
Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea resound, and all that fills it.

### 12
Let the fields exult, and all that is in them. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy

### 13
before the LORD, for He is comingâ€”He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in His faithfulness.
