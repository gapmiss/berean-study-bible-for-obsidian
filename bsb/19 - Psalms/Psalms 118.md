### 1
Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.

### 2
Let Israel say, "His loving devotion endures forever."

### 3
Let the house of Aaron say, "His loving devotion endures forever."

### 4
Let those who fear the LORD say, "His loving devotion endures forever."

### 5
In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered and set me free.

### 6
The LORD is with me; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

### 7
The LORD is with me; He is my helper. Therefore I will look in triumph on those who hate me.

### 8
It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.

### 9
It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.

### 10
All the nations surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I will surely cut them off.

### 11
They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I will surely cut them off.

### 12
They swarmed around me like bees; they were extinguished like a fire of thorns; in the name of the LORD I will surely cut them off.

### 13
I was pushed so hard I was falling, but the LORD helped me.

### 14
The LORD is my strength and my song, and He has become my salvation.

### 15
Shouts of joy and salvation resound in the tents of the righteous: "The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!

### 16
The right hand of the LORD is exalted! The right hand of the LORD performs with valor!"

### 17
I will not die, but I will live and proclaim what the LORD has done.

### 18
The LORD disciplined me severely, but He has not given me over to death.

### 19
Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will enter and give thanks to the LORD.

### 20
This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it.

### 21
I will give You thanks, for You have answered me, and You have become my salvation.

### 22
The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.

### 23
This is from the LORD, and it is marvelous in our eyes.

### 24
This is the day that the LORD has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.

### 25
O LORD, save us, we pray. We beseech You, O LORD, cause us to prosper!

### 26
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD. From the house of the LORD we bless you.

### 27
The LORD is God and has made His light shine upon us. Bind the festival sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.

### 28
You are my God, and I will give You thanks. You are my God, and I will exalt You.

### 29
Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever.
