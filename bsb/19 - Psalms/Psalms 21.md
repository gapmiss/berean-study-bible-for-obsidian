# Psalms 21

[[Psalms 20]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 22]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. O LORD, the king rejoices in Your strength. How greatly he exults in Your salvation!

### 2
You have granted his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah

### 3
For You welcomed him with rich blessings; You placed on his head a crown of pure gold.

### 4
He asked You for life, and You granted itâ€”length of days, forever and ever.

### 5
Great is his glory in Your salvation; You bestow on him splendor and majesty.

### 6
For You grant him blessings forever; You cheer him with joy in Your presence.

### 7
For the king trusts in the LORD; through the loving devotion of the Most High, he will not be shaken.

### 8
Your hand will apprehend all your enemies; Your right hand will seize those who hate you.

### 9
You will place them in a fiery furnace at the time of Your appearing. In His wrath the LORD will engulf them, and the fire will consume them.

### 10
You will wipe their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from the sons of men.

### 11
Though they intend You harm, the schemes they devise will not prevail.

### 12
For You will put them to flight when Your bow is trained upon them.

### 13
Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your power.
