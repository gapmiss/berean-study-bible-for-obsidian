### 1
Hallelujah! Praise the name of the LORD. Give praise, O servants of the LORD,

### 2
who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.

### 3
Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.

### 4
For the LORD has chosen Jacob as His own, Israel as His treasured possession.

### 5
For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is above all gods.

### 6
The LORD does whatever pleases Him in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all their depths.

### 7
He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings the wind from His storehouses.

### 8
He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, of both man and beast.

### 9
He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.

### 10
He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings:

### 11
Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.

### 12
He gave their land as an inheritance, a heritage to His people Israel.

### 13
Your name, O LORD, endures forever, Your renown, O LORD, through all generations.

### 14
For the LORD will vindicate His people and will have compassion on His servants.

### 15
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.

### 16
They have mouths but cannot speak, eyes but cannot see.

### 17
They have ears but cannot hear, nor is there breath in their mouths.

### 18
Those who make them will be like them, as will all who trust in them.

### 19
O house of Israel, praise the LORD; O house of Aaron, praise the LORD;

### 20
O house of Levi, praise the LORD; you who fear the LORD, praise the LORD!

### 21
Blessed be the LORD from Zion—He who dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
