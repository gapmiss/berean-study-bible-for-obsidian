### 1
A Psalm of praise. Of David. I will exalt You, my God and King; I will bless Your name forever and ever.

### 2
Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever.

### 3
Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; His greatness is unsearchable.

### 4
One generation will commend Your works to the next, and they shall proclaim Your mighty acts,

### 5
the glorious splendor of Your majesty. And I will meditate on Your wondrous works.

### 6
They will proclaim the power of Your awesome deeds, and I will declare Your greatness.

### 7
They will extol the fame of Your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of Your righteousness.

### 8
The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion.

### 9
The LORD is good to all; His compassion rests on all He has made.

### 10
All You have made will give You thanks, O LORD, and Your saints shall bless You.

### 11
They will tell of the glory of Your kingdom and speak of Your might,

### 12
to make known to men Your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of Your kingdom.

### 13
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Your dominion endures through all generations. The LORD is faithful in all His words and kind in all His actions.

### 14
The LORD upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.

### 15
The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in season.

### 16
You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

### 17
The LORD is righteous in all His ways and kind in all His deeds.

### 18
The LORD is near to all who call on Him, to all who call out to Him in truth.

### 19
He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and saves them.

### 20
The LORD preserves all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy.

### 21
My mouth will declare the praise of the LORD; let every creature bless His holy name forever and ever.
