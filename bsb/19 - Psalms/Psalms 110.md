### 1
A Psalm of David. The LORD said to my Lord: "Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."

### 2
The LORD will extend Your mighty scepter from Zion: "Rule in the midst of your enemies."

### 3
Your people shall be willing on Your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, to You belongs the dew of Your youth.

### 4
The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind: "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."

### 5
The Lord is at Your right hand; He will crush kings in the day of His wrath.

### 6
He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead; He will crush the leaders far and wide.

### 7
He will drink from the brook by the road; therefore He will lift up His head.
