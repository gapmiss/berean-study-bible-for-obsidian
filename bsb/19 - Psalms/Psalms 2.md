# Psalms 2

[[Psalms 1]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 3]]

---

### 1
Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?

### 2
The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together, against the LORD and against His Anointed One:

### 3
"Let us break Their chains and cast away Their cords."

### 4
The One enthroned in the heavens laughs; the Lord taunts them.

### 5
Then He rebukes them in His anger, and terrifies them in His fury:

### 6
"I have installed My King on Zion, upon My holy hill."

### 7
I will proclaim the decree spoken to Me by the LORD: "You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.

### 8
Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, the ends of the earth Your possession.

### 9
You will break them with an iron scepter; You will shatter them like pottery."

### 10
Therefore be wise, O kings; be admonished, O judges of the earth.

### 11
Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

### 12
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you perish in your rebellion, when His wrath ignites in an instant. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.
