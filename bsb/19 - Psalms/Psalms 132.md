### 1
A Song of Ascents. O LORD, remember on behalf of David all the hardships he endured,

### 2
how he swore an oath to the LORD, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

### 3
"I will not enter my house or get into my bed,

### 4
I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,

### 5
until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob."

### 6
We heard the ark was in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.

### 7
Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His footstool.

### 8
Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.

### 9
May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and Your saints shout for joy.

### 10
For the sake of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one.

### 11
The LORD swore an oath to David, a promise He will not revoke: "One of your descendants I will set upon your throne.

### 12
If your sons keep My covenant and the testimony I will teach them, then their sons will also sit on your throne forever and ever."

### 13
For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home:

### 14
"This is My resting place forever and ever; here I will dwell, for I have desired this home.

### 15
I will bless her with abundant provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.

### 16
I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will sing out in joy.

### 17
There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.

### 18
I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown upon him will gleam."
