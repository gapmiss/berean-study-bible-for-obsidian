# Psalms 29

[[Psalms 28]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 30]]

### 1
A Psalm of David. Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.

### 2
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness.

### 3
The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders; the LORD is heard over many waters.

### 4
The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic.

### 5
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon.

### 6
He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox.

### 7
The voice of the LORD strikes with flames of fire.

### 8
The voice of the LORD shakes the desert; the LORD shakes the Desert of Kadesh.

### 9
The voice of the LORD twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in His temple all cry, "Glory!"

### 10
The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD is enthroned as King forever.

### 11
The LORD gives His people strength; the LORD blesses His people with peace.
