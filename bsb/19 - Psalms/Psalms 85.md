# Psalms 85

[[Psalms 84]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 86]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. You showed favor to Your land, O LORD; You restored Jacob from captivity.

### 2
You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah

### 3
You withheld all Your fury; You turned from Your burning anger.

### 4
Restore us, O God of our salvation, and put away Your displeasure toward us.

### 5
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?

### 6
Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?

### 7
Show us Your loving devotion, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation.

### 8
I will listen to what God the LORD will say; for He will surely speak peace to His people and His saints; He will not let them return to folly.

### 9
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that His glory may dwell in our land.

### 10
Loving devotion and truth have joined together; righteousness and peace have kissed.

### 11
Truth sprouts from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.

### 12
The LORD will indeed provide what is good, and our land will yield its increase.

### 13
Righteousness will go before Him to prepare the way for His steps.
