# Psalms 17

[[Psalms 16]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 18]]

### 1
A Prayer of David. Hear, O LORD, my righteous plea; listen to my cry. Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit.

### 2
May my vindication come from Your presence; may Your eyes see what is right.

### 3
You have tried my heart; You have visited me in the night. You have tested me and found no evil; I have resolved not to sin with my mouth.

### 4
As for the deeds of menâ€”by the word of Your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.

### 5
My steps have clung to Your paths; my feet have not slipped.

### 6
I call on You, O God, for You will answer me. Incline Your ear to me; hear my words.

### 7
Show the wonders of Your loving devotion, You who save by Your right hand those who seek refuge from their foes.

### 8
Keep me as the apple of Your eye; hide me in the shadow of Your wings

### 9
from the wicked who assail me, from my mortal enemies who surround me.

### 10
They have closed their callous hearts; their mouths speak with arrogance.

### 11
They have tracked us down, and now surround us; their eyes are set to cast us to the ground,

### 12
like a lion greedy for prey, like a young lion lurking in ambush.

### 13
Arise, O LORD, confront them! Bring them to their knees; deliver me from the wicked by Your sword,

### 14
from such men, O LORD, by Your hand, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. You fill their bellies with Your treasure and satisfy their sons; so they leave their abundance to their children.

### 15
As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I will be satisfied with Your presence.
