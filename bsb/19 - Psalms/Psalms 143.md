# Psalms 143

[[Psalms 142]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 144]]

### 1
A Psalm of David. O LORD, hear my prayer. In Your faithfulness, give ear to my plea; in Your righteousness, answer me.

### 2
Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for no one alive is righteous before You.

### 3
For the enemy has pursued my soul, crushing my life to the ground, making me dwell in darkness like those long since dead.

### 4
My spirit grows faint within me; my heart is dismayed inside me.

### 5
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I consider the work of Your hands.

### 6
I stretch out my hands to You; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah

### 7
Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide Your face from me, or I will be like those who go down to the Pit.

### 8
Let me hear Your loving devotion in the morning, for I have put my trust in You. Teach me the way I should walk, for to You I lift up my soul.

### 9
Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD; I flee to You for refuge.

### 10
Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. May Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.

### 11
For the sake of Your name, O LORD, revive me. In Your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.

### 12
And in Your loving devotion, cut off my enemies. Wipe out all who afflict me, for I am Your servant.
