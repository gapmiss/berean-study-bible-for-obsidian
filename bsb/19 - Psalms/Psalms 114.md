# Psalms 114

[[Psalms 113]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 115]]

### 1
When Israel departed from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,

### 2
Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel His dominion.

### 3
The sea observed and fled; the Jordan turned back;

### 4
the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.

### 5
Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,

### 6
O mountains, that you skipped like rams, O hills, like lambs?

### 7
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,

### 8
who turned the rock into a pool, the flint into a fountain of water.
