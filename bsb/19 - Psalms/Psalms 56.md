# Psalms 56

[[Psalms 55]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 57]]

---

### 1
For the choirmaster. To the tune of "A Dove on Distant Oaks." A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God, for men are hounding me; all day long they press their attack.

### 2
My enemies pursue me all day long, for many proudly assail me.

### 3
When I am afraid, I will trust in You.

### 4
In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

### 5
All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are of my demise.

### 6
They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, while they wait to take my life.

### 7
In spite of such sin, shall they escape? In Your anger, O God, cast down the nations.

### 8
You have taken account of my wanderings; You have put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book?

### 9
Then my enemies will retreat on the day I cry for help. By this I will know that God is on my side.

### 10
In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,

### 11
in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

### 12
Your vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You.

### 13
For You have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
