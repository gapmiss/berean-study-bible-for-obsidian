Hallelujah! Praise God in His sanctuary. Praise Him in His mighty heavens.

Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him for His excellent greatness.

Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet; praise Him with the harp and lyre.

Praise Him with tambourine and dancing; praise Him with the strings and flute.

Praise Him with clashing cymbals; praise Him with resounding cymbals.

Let everything that has breath praise the LORD. Hallelujah!
