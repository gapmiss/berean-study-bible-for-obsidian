For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm. A Song. May God be gracious to us and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us, Selah

that Your ways may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.

### 3
Let the peoples praise You, O God; let all the peoples praise You.

### 4
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for You judge the peoples justly and lead the nations of the earth. Selah

### 5
Let the peoples praise You, O God; let all the peoples praise You.

The earth has yielded its harvest; God, our God, blesses us.

### 7
God blesses us, that all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.
