# Psalms 13

[[Psalms 12]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 14]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?

### 2
How long must I wrestle in my soul, with sorrow in my heart each day? How long will my enemy dominate me?

### 3
See me and respond, O LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death,

### 4
lest my enemy say, "I have overcome him," and my foes rejoice when I fall.

### 5
But I have trusted in Your loving devotion; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation.

### 6
I will sing to the LORD, for He has been good to me.
