# Psalms 109

[[Psalms 108]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 110]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, do not be silent.

### 2
For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; they speak against me with lying tongues.

### 3
They surround me with hateful words and attack me without cause.

### 4
In return for my love they accuse me, but I am a man of prayer.

### 5
They repay me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

### 6
Set over him a wicked man; let an accuser stand at his right hand.

### 7
When he is tried, let him be found guilty, and may his prayer be regarded as sin.

### 8
May his days be few; may another take his position.

### 9
May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.

### 10
May his children wander as beggars; may they seek sustenance far from their ruined homes.

### 11
May the creditor seize all he owns, and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.

### 12
May there be none to extend kindness, and no one to favor his fatherless children.

### 13
May his descendants be cut off; may their name be blotted out from the next generation.

### 14
May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and the sin of his mother never be erased.

### 15
May their sins always remain before the LORD, that He may cut off their memory from the earth.

### 16
For he never thought to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and brokenhearted, even to their death.

### 17
The cursing he loved, may it fall on him; the blessing he refused to delight in, may it be far from him.

### 18
The cursing he wore like a coat, may it soak into his body like water, and into his bones like oil.

### 19
May it be like a robe wrapped about him, like a belt tied forever around him.

### 20
May this be the LORD's reward to my accusers, to those who speak evil against me.

### 21
But You, O GOD, the Lord, deal kindly with me for the sake of Your name; deliver me by the goodness of Your loving devotion.

### 22
For I am poor and needy; my heart is wounded within me.

### 23
I am fading away like a lengthening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.

### 24
My knees are weak from fasting, and my body grows lean and gaunt.

### 25
I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they shake their heads.

### 26
Help me, O LORD my God; save me according to Your loving devotion.

### 27
Let them know that this is Your hand, that You, O LORD, have done it.

### 28
Though they curse, You will bless. When they rise up, they will be put to shame, but Your servant will rejoice.

### 29
My accusers will be clothed with disgrace; they will wear their shame like a robe.

### 30
With my mouth I will thank the LORD profusely; I will praise Him in the presence of many.

### 31
For He stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save him from the condemners of his soul.
