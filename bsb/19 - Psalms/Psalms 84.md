### 1
For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How lovely is Your dwelling place, O LORD of Hosts.

### 2
My soul longs, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.

### 3
Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself where she places her young by Your altars, O LORD of Hosts, my King and my God.

### 4
How blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they are ever praising You. Selah

### 5
Blessed are those whose strength is in You, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.

### 6
As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; even the autumn rain covers it with pools.

### 7
They go from strength to strength, until each appears before God in Zion.

### 8
O LORD God of Hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah

### 9
Behold our shield, O God, and look with favor on the face of Your anointed.

### 10
For better is one day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.

### 11
For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.

### 12
O LORD of Hosts, how blessed is the man who trusts in You!
