# Psalms 15

### 1
A Psalm of David. O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy hill?

### 2
He who walks with integrity and practices righteousness, who speaks the truth from his heart,

### 3
who has no slander on his tongue, who does no harm to his neighbor, who casts no scorn on his friend,

### 4
who despises the vile but honors those who fear the LORD, who does not revise a costly oath,

### 5
who lends his money without interest and refuses a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
