# Psalms 5

[[Psalms 4]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 6]]

### 1
For the choirmaster, to be accompanied by flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning.

### 2
Attend to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to You I pray.

### 3
In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice; at daybreak I lay my plea before You and wait in expectation.

### 4
For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; no evil can dwell with You.

### 5
The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; You hate all workers of iniquity.

### 6
You destroy those who tell lies; the LORD abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.

### 7
But I, by the abundance of Your loving devotion, will enter Your house; in reverence I will bow down toward Your holy temple.

### 8
Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; make straight Your way before me.

### 9
For not a word they speak can be trusted; destruction is within them. Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.

### 10
Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own devices. Drive them out for their many transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.

### 11
But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; let them ever shout for joy. May You shelter them, that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.

### 12
For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous; You surround them with the shield of your favor.
