### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout unto God with a voice of triumph.

### 2
How awesome is the LORD the Most High, the great King over all the earth!

### 3
He subdues nations beneath us, and peoples under our feet.

### 4
He chooses our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom He loves. Selah

### 5
God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the LORD with the sound of trumpets.

### 6
Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises!

### 7
For God is King of all the earth; sing profound praises to Him.

### 8
God reigns over the nations; God is seated on His holy throne.

### 9
The nobles of the nations have assembled as the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God; He is highly exalted.
