### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.

### 2
May He send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion.

### 3
May He remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings. Selah

### 4
May He give you the desires of your heart and make all your plans succeed.

### 5
May we shout for joy at your victory and raise a banner in the name of our God. May the LORD sanction all your petitions.

### 6
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He answers him from His holy heaven with the saving power of His right hand.

### 7
Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.

### 8
They collapse and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.

### 9
O LORD, deliver the king. Answer us on the day we call.
