# Psalms 80

[[Psalms 79]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 81]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. To the tune of "The Lilies of the Covenant." A Psalm of Asaph. Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth.

### 2
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, rally Your power and come to save us.

### 3
Restore us, O God, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.

### 4
O LORD God of Hosts, how long will Your anger smolder against the prayers of Your people?

### 5
You fed them with the bread of tears and made them drink their full measure of tears.

### 6
You make us contend with our neighbors; our enemies mock us.

### 7
Restore us, O God of Hosts, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.

### 8
You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and transplanted it.

### 9
You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.

### 10
The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.

### 11
It sent out its branches to the Sea, and its shoots toward the River.

### 12
Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pick its fruit?

### 13
The boar from the forest ravages it, and the creatures of the field feed upon it.

### 14
Return, O God of Hosts, we pray! Look down from heaven and see! Attend to this vine,

### 15
the root Your right hand has planted, the branch You have raised up for Yourself.

### 16
Your vine has been cut down and burned; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.

### 17
Let Your hand be upon the man at Your right hand, on the son of man You have raised up for Yourself.

### 18
Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your name.

### 19
Restore us, O LORD God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
