# Psalms 61

[[Psalms 60]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 62]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God, attend to my prayer.

### 2
From the ends of the earth I call out to You whenever my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

### 3
For You have been my refuge, a tower of strength against the enemy.

### 4
Let me dwell in Your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah

### 5
For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance reserved for those who fear Your name.

### 6
Increase the days of the king's life; may his years span many generations.

### 7
May he sit enthroned in God's presence forever; appoint Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness to guard him.

### 8
Then I will ever sing praise to Your name, fulfilling my vows day by day.
