# Psalms 62

[[Psalms 61]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 63]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. In God alone my soul finds rest; my salvation comes from Him.

### 2
He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress, I will never be shaken.

### 3
How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you throw him down like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?

### 4
They fully intend to topple him from his lofty perch; they delight in lies; with their mouths they bless, but inwardly they curse. Selah

### 5
Rest in God alone, O my soul, for my hope comes from Him.

### 6
He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress, I will not be shaken.

### 7
My salvation and my honor rest on God, my strong rock; my refuge is in God.

### 8
Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is our refuge. Selah

### 9
Lowborn men are but a vapor; the exalted but a lie. Weighed on the scale, they are pushed up; together they are but a breath.

### 10
Place no trust in extortion, or false hope in stolen goods. If your riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.

### 11
God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: that power belongs to God,

### 12
and loving devotion to You, O Lord. For You will repay each man according to his deeds.
