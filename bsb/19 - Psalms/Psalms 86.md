# Psalms 86

[[Psalms 85]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 87]]

### 1
A Prayer of David. Incline Your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.

### 2
Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You are my God; save Your servant who trusts in You.

### 3
Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I call to You all day long.

### 4
Bring joy to Your servant, for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.

### 5
For You, O Lord, are kind and forgiving, rich in loving devotion to all who call on You.

### 6
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and attend to my plea for mercy.

### 7
In the day of my distress I will call on You, for You will answer me.

### 8
O Lord, there is none like You among the gods, nor any works like Yours.

### 9
All the nations You have made will come and bow before You, O Lord, and they will glorify Your name.

### 10
For You are great and perform wonders; You alone are God.

### 11
Teach me Your way, O LORD, and I will walk in Your truth. Grant me undividedness of heart so that I may fear Your name.

### 12
I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify Your name forever.

### 13
For great is Your loving devotion to me; You have delivered me from the depths of Sheol.

### 14
The arrogant rise against me, O God; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, with no regard for You.

### 15
But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and truth.

### 16
Turn to me and have mercy; grant Your strength to Your servant; save the son of Your maidservant.

### 17
Show me a sign of Your goodness, that my enemies may see and be ashamed, for You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
