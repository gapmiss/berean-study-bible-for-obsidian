# Psalms 125

[[Psalms 124]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 126]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be moved; it abides forever.

### 2
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore.

### 3
For the scepter of the wicked will not rest upon the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not put forth their hands to injustice.

### 4
Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to the upright in heart.

### 5
But those who turn aside to crooked ways, the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
