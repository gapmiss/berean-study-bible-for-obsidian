# Psalms 128

[[Psalms 127]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 129]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Blessed are all who fear the LORD, who walk in His ways!

### 2
For when you eat the fruit of your labor, blessings and prosperity will be yours.

### 3
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine flourishing within your house, your sons like olive shoots sitting around your table.

### 4
In this way indeed shall blessing come to the man who fears the LORD.

### 5
May the LORD bless you from Zion, that you may see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life,

### 6
that you may see your children's children! Peace be upon Israel.
