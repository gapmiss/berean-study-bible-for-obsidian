# Psalms 91

[[Psalms 90]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 92]]

### 1
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.

### 2
I will say to the LORD, "You are my refuge and fortress, my God, in whom I trust."

### 3
Surely He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly plague.

### 4
He will cover you with His feathers; under His wings you will find refuge; His faithfulness is a shield and rampart.

### 5
You will not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day,

### 6
the plague that stalks in darkness, or the calamity that destroys at noon.

### 7
Though a thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, no harm will come near you.

### 8
You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked.

### 9
Because you have made the LORD your dwelling—my refuge, the Most High—

### 10
no evil will befall you, no plague will approach your tent.

### 11
For He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.

### 12
They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.

### 13
You will tread on the lion and cobra; you will trample the young lion and serpent.

### 14
"Because he loves Me, I will deliver him; because he knows My name, I will protect him.

### 15
When he calls out to Me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver and honor him.

### 16
With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation."
