### 1
Of Solomon. Endow the king with Your justice, O God, and the son of the king with Your righteousness.

### 2
He will judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted with justice.

### 3
May the mountains bring peace to the people and the hills bring righteousness.

### 4
May he vindicate the afflicted among the people; may he save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor.

### 5
May they fear him as long as the sun shines, as long as the moon remains, through all generations.

### 6
May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth.

### 7
May the righteous flourish in his days and prosperity abound, until the moon is no more.

### 8
May he rule from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.

### 9
May the nomads bow before him, and his enemies lick the dust.

### 10
May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.

### 11
May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.

### 12
For he shall deliver the needy who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper.

### 13
He will have compassion on the poor and needy and save the lives of the oppressed.

### 14
He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for their blood is precious in his sight.

### 15
Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him; may they bless him all day long.

### 16
May there be an abundance of grain in the land; may it sway atop the hills. May its fruit trees flourish like the forests of Lebanon, and its people like the grass of the field.

### 17
May his name endure forever; may his name increase as long as the sun shines. In him may all nations be blessed; may they call him blessed.

### 18
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.

### 19
And blessed be His glorious name forever; may all the earth be filled with His glory. Amen and amen.

### 20
This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.
