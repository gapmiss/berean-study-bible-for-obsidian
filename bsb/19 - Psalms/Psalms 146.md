# Psalms 146

[[Psalms 145]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 147]]

### 1
Hallelujah! Praise the LORD, O my soul.

### 2
I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.

### 3
Put not your trust in princes, in mortal man, who cannot save.

### 4
When his spirit departs, he returns to the ground; on that very day his plans perish.

### 5
Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,

### 6
the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He remains faithful forever,

### 7
executing justice for the oppressed, giving food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free,

### 8
the LORD opens the eyes of the blind, the LORD lifts those who are weighed down, the LORD loves the righteous.

### 9
The LORD protects the sojourners; He sustains the fatherless and the widow, but the ways of the wicked He frustrates.

### 10
The LORD reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Hallelujah!
