# Psalms 55

[[Psalms 54]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 56]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Listen to my prayer, O God, and do not ignore my plea.

### 2
Attend to me and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and distraught

### 3
at the voice of the enemy, at the pressure of the wicked. For they release disaster upon me and revile me in their anger.

### 4
My heart murmurs within me, and the terrors of death assail me.

### 5
Fear and trembling grip me, and horror has overwhelmed me.

### 6
I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.

### 7
How far away I would flee; in the wilderness I would remain. Selah

### 8
I would hurry to my shelter far from this raging tempest."

### 9
O Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.

### 10
Day and night they encircle the walls, while malice and trouble lie within.

### 11
Destruction is in the midst; oppression and deceit never leave the streets.

### 12
For it is not an enemy who insults me—then I could endure; it is not a foe who rises against me—from him I could hide.

### 13
But it is you, a man like myself, my companion and close friend.

### 14
We shared sweet fellowship together; we walked with the crowd into the house of God.

### 15
Let death seize them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, for evil is with them in their homes.

### 16
But I call to God, and the LORD will save me.

### 17
Morning, noon, and night, I cry out in distress, and He will hear my voice.

### 18
He will redeem my soul in peace from the battle; though many are against me,

### 19
God will hear and humiliate them—the One enthroned for the ages—Selah because they do not change and they have no fear of God.

### 20
My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.

### 21
His speech is smooth as butter, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, yet they are swords unsheathed.

### 22
Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken.

### 23
But You, O God, will bring them down to the Pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.
