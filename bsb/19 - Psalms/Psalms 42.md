# Psalms 42

[[Psalms 41]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 43]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul longs after You, O God.

### 2
My soul thirsts for God, the living God. When shall I come and appear in God's presence?

### 3
My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"

### 4
These things come to mind as I pour out my soul: how I walked with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and praise.

### 5
Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him for the salvation of His presence.

### 6
O my God, my soul despairs within me. Therefore I remember You from the land of Jordan and the peaks of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.

### 7
Deep calls to deep in the roar of Your waterfalls; all Your breakers and waves have rolled over me.

### 8
The LORD decrees His loving devotion by day; and at night His song is with me—a prayer to the God of my life.

### 9
I will say to God, my rock, "Why have You forgotten me? Why must I walk in sorrow because of the enemy's oppression?"

### 10
Like the crushing of my bones, my enemies taunt me, while they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"

### 11
Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, my Savior and my God.
