# Psalms 10

[[Psalms 9]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 11]]

---

### 1
Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? Why do You hide in times of trouble?

### 2
In pride the wicked pursue the needy; let them be caught in the schemes they devise.

### 3
For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.

### 4
In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; in all his schemes there is no God.

### 5
He is secure in his ways at all times; Your lofty judgments are far from him; he sneers at all his foes.

### 6
He says to himself, "I shall not be moved; from age to age I am free of distress."

### 7
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and violence; trouble and malice are under his tongue.

### 8
He lies in wait near the villages; in ambush he slays the innocent; his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.

### 9
He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket; he lurks to seize the oppressed; he catches the lowly in his net.

### 10
They are crushed and beaten down; the hapless fall prey to his strength.

### 11
He says to himself, "God has forgotten; He hides His face and never sees."

### 12
Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.

### 13
Why has the wicked man renounced God? He says to himself, "You will never call me to account."

### 14
But You have regarded trouble and grief; You consider it to take in hand. The victim entrusts himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.

### 15
Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call his wickedness into account until none is left to find.

### 16
The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations will vanish from His land.

### 17
You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their hearts. You will incline Your ear,

### 18
to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed, that the men of the earth may strike terror no more.
