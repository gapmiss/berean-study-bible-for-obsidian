# Psalms 23

[[Psalms 22]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 24]]

### 1
A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

### 2
He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.

### 3
He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of His name.

### 4
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

### 5
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

### 6
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
