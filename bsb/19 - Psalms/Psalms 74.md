# Psalms 74

[[Psalms 73]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 75]]

### 1
A Maskil of Asaph. Why have You rejected us forever, O God? Why does Your anger burn against the sheep of Your pasture?

### 2
Remember Your congregation, which You purchased long ago and redeemed as the tribe of Your inheritanceâ€”Mount Zion where You dwell.

### 3
Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins, to everything in the sanctuary the enemy has destroyed.

### 4
Your foes have roared within Your meeting place; they have unfurled their banners as signs,

### 5
like men wielding axes, in a thicket of trees,

### 6
and smashing all the carved work with hatchets and picks.

### 7
They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; they have defiled the dwelling place of Your name.

### 8
They said in their hearts, "We will crush them completely." They burned down every place where God met us in the land.

### 9
There are no signs for us to see. There is no longer any prophet. And none of us knows how long this will last.

### 10
How long, O God, will the enemy taunt You? Will the foe revile Your name forever?

### 11
Why do You withdraw Your hand? Stretch out Your right hand and destroy them!

### 12
Yet God is my King from of old, working salvation on the earth.

### 13
You divided the sea by Your strength; You smashed the heads of the dragons of the sea;

### 14
You crushed the heads of Leviathan; You fed him to the creatures of the desert.

### 15
You broke open the fountain and the flood; You dried up the ever-flowing rivers.

### 16
The day is Yours, and also the night; You established the moon and the sun.

### 17
You set all the boundaries of the earth; You made the summer and winter.

### 18
Remember how the enemy has mocked You, O LORD, how a foolish people has spurned Your name.

### 19
Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts; do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever.

### 20
Consider Your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.

### 21
Do not let the oppressed retreat in shame; may the poor and needy praise Your name.

### 22
Rise up, O God, defend Your cause! Remember how the fool mocks You all day long.

### 23
Do not disregard the clamor of Your adversaries, the uproar of Your enemies that ascends continually.
