# Psalms 137

[[Psalms 136]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 138]]

---

### 1
By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion.

### 2
There on the poplars we hung our harps,

### 3
for there our captors requested a song, and our tormentors demanded songs of joy: "Sing us a song of Zion."

### 4
How can we sing a song of the LORD in a foreign land?

### 5
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand cease to function.

### 6
May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy!

### 7
Remember, O LORD, the sons of Edom on the day Jerusalem fell: "Destroy it," they said, "tear it down to its foundations!"

### 8
O Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction, blessed is he who repays you as you have done to us.

### 9
Blessed is he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.
