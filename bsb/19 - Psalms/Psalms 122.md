# Psalms 122

[[Psalms 121]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 123]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Of David. I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD."

### 2
Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem.

### 3
Jerusalem is built up as a city united together,

### 4
where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.

### 5
For there the thrones of judgment stand, the thrones of the house of David.

### 6
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May those who love you prosper.

### 7
May there be peace within your walls, and prosperity inside your fortresses."

### 8
For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will say, "Peace be within you."

### 9
For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity.
