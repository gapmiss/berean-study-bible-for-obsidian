### 1
For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory above the heavens.

### 2
From the lips of children and infants You have ordained praise on account of Your adversaries, to silence the enemy and avenger.

### 3
When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You set in place—

### 4
what is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You care for him?

### 5
You made him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor.

### 6
You made him ruler of the works of Your hands; You have placed everything under his feet:

### 7
all sheep and oxen, and even the beasts of the field,

### 8
the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.

### 9
O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!
