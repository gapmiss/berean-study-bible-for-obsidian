# Psalms 12

[[Psalms 11]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 13]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. According to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, O LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.

### 2
They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and a double heart.

### 3
May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks proud things.

### 4
They say, "With our tongues we will prevail. We own our lipsâ€”who can be our master?"

### 5
"For the cause of the oppressed and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says the LORD. "I will bring safety to him who yearns."

### 6
The words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace, like gold purified sevenfold.

### 7
You, O LORD, will keep us; You will forever guard us from this generation.

### 8
The wicked wander freely, and vileness is exalted among men.
