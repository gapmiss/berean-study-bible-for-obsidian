### 1
The LORD reigns, let the nations tremble! He is enthroned above the cherubim. Let the earth quake.

### 2
Great is the LORD in Zion; He is exalted above all the peoples.

### 3
Let them praise Your great and awesome nameâ€”He is holy!

### 4
The mighty King loves justice. You have established equity; You have exercised justice and righteousness in Jacob.

### 5
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at His footstool; He is holy!

### 6
Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel among those who called on His name. They called to the LORD and He answered.

### 7
He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud; they kept His decrees and the statutes He gave them.

### 8
O LORD our God, You answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, yet an avenger of their misdeeds.

### 9
Exalt the LORD our God and worship at His holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.
