# Psalms 39

[[Psalms 38]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 40]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, "I will watch my ways so that I will not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle as long as the wicked are present."

### 2
I was speechless and still; I held my peace, even from good, and my sorrow was stirred.

### 3
My heart grew hot within me; as I mused, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:

### 4
"Show me, O LORD, my end and the measure of my days. Let me know how fleeting my life is.

### 5
You, indeed, have made my days as handbreadths, and my lifetime as nothing before You. Truly each man at his best exists as but a breath. Selah

### 6
Surely every man goes about like a phantom; surely he bustles in vain; he heaps up riches not knowing who will haul them away.

### 7
Now, Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in You.

### 8
Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not make me the reproach of fools.

### 9
I have become mute; I do not open my mouth because it is You who have done it.

### 10
Remove Your scourge from me; I am perishing by the force of Your hand.

### 11
You discipline and correct a man for his iniquity, consuming like a moth what he holds dear; surely each man is but a vapor. Selah

### 12
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. For I am a foreigner dwelling with You, a sojourner like all my fathers.

### 13
Turn Your gaze away from me, that I may again be cheered before I depart and am no more."
