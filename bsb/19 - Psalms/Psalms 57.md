# Psalms 57

[[Psalms 56]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 58]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A Miktam of David, when he fled from Saul into the cave. Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy, for in You my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of Your wings I will take shelter until the danger has passed.

### 2
I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills His purpose for me.

### 3
He reaches down from heaven and saves me; He rebukes those who trample me. Selah God sends forth His loving devotion and His truth.

### 4
My soul is among the lions; I lie down with ravenous beasts whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.

### 5
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.

### 6
They spread a net for my feet; my soul was despondent. They dug a pit before me, but they themselves have fallen into it! Selah

### 7
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing and make music.

### 8
Awake, O glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.

### 9
I will praise You, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing Your praises among the peoples.

### 10
For Your loving devotion reaches to the heavens, Your faithfulness to the clouds.

### 11
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; may Your glory cover all the earth.
