### 1
A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom. O LORD, how my foes have increased! How many rise up against me!

### 2
Many say of me, "God will not deliver him." Selah

### 3
But You, O LORD, are a shield around me, my glory, and the One who lifts my head.

### 4
To the LORD I cry aloud, and He answers me from His holy hill. Selah

### 5
I lie down and sleep; I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.

### 6
I will not fear the myriads set against me on every side.

### 7
Arise, O LORD! Deliver me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.

### 8
Salvation belongs to the LORD; may Your blessing be on Your people. Selah
