# Psalms 63

[[Psalms 62]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 64]]

### 1
A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah. O God, You are my God, earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You; my body yearns for You in a dry and weary land without water.

### 2
So I have seen You in the sanctuary, to behold Your power and glory.

### 3
Because Your loving devotion is better than life, my lips will glorify You.

### 4
So I will bless You as long as I live; in Your name I will lift my hands.

### 5
My soul is satisfied as with the richest of foods; with joyful lips my mouth will praise You.

### 6
When I remember You on my bed, I think of You through the watches of the night.

### 7
For You are my help; I will sing for joy in the shadow of Your wings.

### 8
My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.

### 9
But those who seek my life to destroy it will go into the depths of the earth.

### 10
They will fall to the power of the sword; they will become the portion of jackals.

### 11
But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will exult, for the mouths of liars will be shut.
