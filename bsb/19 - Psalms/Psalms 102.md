# Psalms 102

[[Psalms 101]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 103]]

### 1
A prayer of one who is afflicted, when he grows faint and pours out his lament before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come before You.

### 2
Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my distress. Incline Your ear to me; answer me quickly when I call.

### 3
For my days vanish like smoke, and my bones burn like glowing embers.

### 4
My heart is afflicted, and withered like grass; I even forget to eat my bread.

### 5
Through my loud groaning, my flesh clings to my bones.

### 6
I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.

### 7
I lie awake; I am like a lone bird on a housetop.

### 8
All day long my enemies taunt me; they ridicule and curse me.

### 9
For I have eaten ashes like bread and mixed my drink with tears,

### 10
because of Your indignation and wrath; for You have picked me up and cast me aside.

### 11
My days are like lengthening shadows, and I wither away like grass.

### 12
But You, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; Your renown endures to all generations.

### 13
You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show her favor—the appointed time has come.

### 14
For Your servants delight in her stones and take pity on her dust.

### 15
So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear Your glory,

### 16
for the LORD will rebuild Zion; He has appeared in His glory.

### 17
He will turn toward the prayer of the destitute; He will not despise their prayer.

### 18
Let this be written for the generation to come, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD.

### 19
For He looked down from the heights of His sanctuary; the LORD gazed out from heaven to earth,

### 20
to hear a prisoner's groaning, to release those condemned to death,

### 21
that they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion and His praise in Jerusalem,

### 22
when peoples and kingdoms assemble to serve the LORD.

### 23
He has broken my strength on the way; He has shortened my days.

### 24
I say: "O my God, do not take me in the midst of my days! Your years go on through all generations.

### 25
In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.

### 26
They will perish, but You remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing You will change them, and they will be passed on.

### 27
But You remain the same, and Your years will never end.

### 28
The children of Your servants will dwell securely, and their descendants will be established before You."
