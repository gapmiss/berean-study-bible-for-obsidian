# Psalms 64

[[Psalms 63]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 65]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Hear, O God, my voice of complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy.

### 2
Hide me from the scheming of the wicked, from the mob of workers of iniquity,

### 3
who sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their bitter words like arrows,

### 4
ambushing the innocent in seclusion, shooting suddenly, without fear.

### 5
They hold fast to their evil purpose; they speak of hiding their snares. "Who will see them?" they say.

### 6
They devise injustice and say, "We have perfected a secret plan." For the inner man and the heart are mysterious.

### 7
But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be wounded.

### 8
They will be made to stumble, their own tongues turned against them. All who see will shake their heads.

### 9
Then all mankind will fear and proclaim the work of God; so they will ponder what He has done.

### 10
Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him; let all the upright in heart exult.
