# Psalms 124

[[Psalms 123]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 125]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Of David. If the LORD had not been on our side—let Israel now declare—

### 2
if the LORD had not been on our side when men attacked us,

### 3
when their anger flared against us, then they would have swallowed us alive,

### 4
then the floods would have engulfed us, the torrent would have overwhelmed us,

### 5
then the raging waters would have swept us away.

### 6
Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.

### 7
We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; the net is torn, and we have slipped away.

### 8
Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
