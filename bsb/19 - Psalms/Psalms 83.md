# Psalms 83

[[Psalms 82]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 84]]

### 1
A Song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, do not keep silent; do not hold Your peace; do not be still, O God.

### 2
See how Your enemies rage, how your foes have reared their heads.

### 3
With cunning they scheme against Your people and conspire against those You cherish,

### 4
saying, "Come, let us erase them as a nation; may the name of Israel be remembered no more."

### 5
For with one mind they plot together, they form an alliance against You—

### 6
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,

### 7
Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with the people of Tyre.

### 8
Even Assyria has joined them, lending strength to the sons of Lot. Selah

### 9
Do to them as You did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon,

### 10
who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground.

### 11
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,

### 12
who said, "Let us possess for ourselves the pastures of God."

### 13
Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind.

### 14
As fire consumes a forest, as a flame sets the mountains ablaze,

### 15
so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm.

### 16
Cover their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD.

### 17
May they be ever ashamed and terrified; may they perish in disgrace.

### 18
May they know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, are Most High over all the earth.
