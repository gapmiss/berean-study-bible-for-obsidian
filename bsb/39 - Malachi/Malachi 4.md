### 1
"For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble; the day is coming when I will set them ablaze," says the LORD of Hosts. "Not a root or branch will be left to them."

### 2
"But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings, and you will go out and leap like calves from the stall.

### 3
Then you will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day I am preparing," says the LORD of Hosts.

### 4
"Remember the law of Moses My servant, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him for all Israel at Horeb.

### 5
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful Day of the LORD.

### 6
And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Otherwise, I will come and strike the land with a curse."
