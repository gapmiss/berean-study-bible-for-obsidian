# Micah 7

[[Micah 6]] | [[Micah]]

---

### 1
Woe is me! For I am like one gathering summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard; there is no cluster to eat, no early fig that I crave.

### 2
The godly man has perished from the earth; there is no one upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood; they hunt each other with a net.

### 3
Both hands are skilled at evil; the prince and the judge demand a bribe; when the powerful utters his evil desire, they all conspire together.

### 4
The best of them is like a brier; the most upright is sharper than a hedge of thorns. The day you post your watchmen, your punishment will come; then their confusion will arise.

### 5
Do not rely on a friend; do not trust in a companion. Seal the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms.

### 6
For a son dishonors his father, a daughter rises against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the members of his own household.

### 7
But as for me, I will look to the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.

### 8
Do not gloat over me, my enemy! Though I have fallen, I will arise; though I sit in darkness, the LORD will be my light.

### 9
Because I have sinned against Him, I must endure the rage of the LORD, until He argues my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me into the light; I will see His righteousness.

### 10
Then my enemy will see and will be covered with shame—she who said to me, "Where is the LORD your God?" My eyes will see her; at that time she will be trampled like mud in the streets.

### 11
The day for rebuilding your walls will come—the day for extending your boundary.

### 12
On that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, even from Egypt to the Euphrates and from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.

### 13
Then the earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants, as the result of their deeds.

### 14
Shepherd with Your staff Your people, the flock of Your inheritance. They live alone in a woodland, surrounded by pastures. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

### 15
As in the days when you came out of Egypt, I will show My wonders.

### 16
Nations will see and be ashamed, deprived of all their might. They will put their hands over their mouths, and their ears will become deaf.

### 17
They will lick the dust like a snake, like reptiles slithering on the ground. They will crawl from their holes in the presence of the LORD our God; they will tremble in fear of you.

### 18
Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance—who does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in loving devotion?

### 19
He will again have compassion on us; He will vanquish our iniquities. You will cast out all our sins into the depths of the sea.

### 20
You will show loyalty to Jacob and loving devotion to Abraham, as You swore to our fathers from days of old.
