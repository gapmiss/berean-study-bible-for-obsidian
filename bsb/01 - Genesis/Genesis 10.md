### 1
This is the account of Noah's sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who also had sons after the flood.

### 2
The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.

### 3
The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.

### 4
And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

### 5
From these, the maritime peoples separated into their territories, according to their languages, by clans within their nations.

### 6
The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.

### 7
The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.

### 8
And Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth.

### 9
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; so it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD."

### 10
His kingdom began in Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

### 11
From that land he went forth into Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,

### 12
and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah.

### 13
And Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites,

### 14
the Pathrusites, the Casluhites, and the Caphtorites (from whom the Philistines came).

### 15
Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,

### 16
the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,

### 17
the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,

### 18
the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans were scattered

### 19
and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.

### 20
These are the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.

### 21
And sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth; Shem was the forefather of all the sons of Eber.

### 22
The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.

### 23
The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.

### 24
And Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber.

### 25
And two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan.

### 26
And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,

### 27
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,

### 28
Obal, Abimael, Sheba,

### 29
Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.

### 30
Their territory extended from Mesha to Sephar, in the eastern hill country.

### 31
These are the sons of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.

### 32
All these are the clans of Noah's sons, according to their generations and nations. From these the nations of the earth spread out after the flood.
