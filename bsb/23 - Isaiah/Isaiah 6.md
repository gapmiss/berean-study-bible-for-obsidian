# Isaiah 6

[[Isaiah 5]] | [[Isaiah]] | [[Isaiah 7]]

### 1
In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted; and the train of His robe filled the temple.

### 2
Above Him stood seraphim, each having six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.

### 3
And they called out to one another: Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts; His glory fills all the earth.

### 4
The doorposts and thresholds shook at the sound of their voices, and the temple was filled with smoke.

### 5
Then I said, "Woe is me, for I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips dwelling among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of Hosts."

### 6
Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.

### 7
And with it he touched my mouth and said, "Now that this has touched your lips, your iniquity is removed and your sin is atoned for."

### 8
Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!"

### 9
And He replied, "Go and tell this people: 'Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.'

### 10
Make the hearts of this people calloused; deafen their ears and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.

### 11
Then I asked, "How long, O Lord?" And He replied, "Until cities lie in ruins without an inhabitant, until the houses are left unoccupied, and the land is desolate and ravaged,

### 12
until the LORD has driven men far away, and the land is utterly forsaken.

### 13
And though a tenth remains in the land, it will be burned again. As the terebinth and oak leave stumps when felled, so the holy seed will be a stump in the land."
