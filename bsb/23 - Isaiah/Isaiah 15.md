# Isaiah 15

[[Isaiah 14]] | [[Isaiah]] | [[Isaiah 16]]

### 1
This is an oracle concerning Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night!

### 2
Dibon goes up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba. Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off.

### 3
In its streets they wear sackcloth; on the rooftops and in the public squares they all wail, falling down weeping.

### 4
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out; their souls tremble within.

### 5
My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath-shelishiyah; with weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith; they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim.

### 6
The waters of Nimrim are dried up; the grass is withered, the foliage is gone, and the vegetation has vanished.

### 7
So they carry their wealth and belongings over the Brook of the Willows.

### 8
For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; it is heard in Beer-elim.

### 9
The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring more upon Dimonâ€”a lion on the fugitives of Moab, and on the remnant of the land.
