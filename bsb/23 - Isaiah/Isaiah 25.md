# Isaiah 25

[[Isaiah 24]] | [[Isaiah]] | [[Isaiah 26]]

---

### 1
O LORD, You are my God. I will exalt You; I will praise Your name. For You have worked wondersâ€”plans formed long ago in perfect faithfulness.

### 2
Indeed, You have turned the city into a heap of rubble, a fortified town into ruins; the fortress of strangers is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.

### 3
Therefore, a strong people will honor You. The cities of ruthless nations will revere You.

### 4
For You have been a refuge for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like rain against a wall,

### 5
like heat in a dry land. You subdue the uproar of foreigners. As the shade of a cloud cools the heat of the day, so the song of the ruthless is silenced.

### 6
On this mountain the LORD of Hosts will prepare a banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, of finely aged wine.

### 7
On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all the peoples, the sheet that covers all the nations;

### 8
He will swallow up death forever. The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face and remove the disgrace of His people from the whole earth. For the LORD has spoken.

### 9
And in that day it will be said, "Surely this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation."

### 10
For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place as straw is trodden into the dung pile.

### 11
He will spread out his hands within it, as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim. His pride will be brought low, despite the cleverness of his hands.

### 12
The high-walled fortress will be brought down, cast to the ground, into the dust.
