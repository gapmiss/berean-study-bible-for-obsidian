### 1
Then the angel showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD, with Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.

### 2
And the LORD said to Satan: "The LORD rebukes you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you! Is not this man a firebrand snatched from the fire?"

### 3
Now Joshua was dressed in filthy garments as he stood before the Angel.

### 4
So the Angel of the LORD said to those standing before Him, "Take off his filthy clothes!" Then He said to Joshua, "See, I have removed your iniquity, and I will clothe you with splendid robes."

### 5
Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So a clean turban was placed on his head, and they clothed him, as the Angel of the LORD stood by.

### 6
Then the Angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua:

### 7
"This is what the LORD of Hosts says: 'If you walk in My ways and keep My instructions, then you will both govern My house and have charge of My courts; and I will give you a place among these standing here.'

### 8
'Hear now, O high priest Joshua, you and your companions seated before you, who are indeed a sign. For behold, I am going to bring My servant, the Branch.

### 9
See the stone I have set before Joshua; on that one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave on it an inscription,' declares the LORD of Hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.

### 10
On that day,' declares the LORD of Hosts, 'each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.'"
