# Psalms 126

[[Psalms 125]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 127]]

### 1
A Song of Ascents. When the LORD restored the captives of Zion, we were like dreamers.

### 2
Then our mouths were filled with laughter and our tongues with shouts of joy. Then it was proclaimed among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."

### 3
The LORD has done great things for us; we are filled with joy.

### 4
Restore our captives, O LORD, like streams in the Negev.

### 5
Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.

### 6
He who goes out weeping, bearing a trail of seed, will surely return with shouts of joy, carrying sheaves of grain.
