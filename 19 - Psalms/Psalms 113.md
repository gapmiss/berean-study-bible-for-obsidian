### 1
Hallelujah! Give praise, O servants of the LORD; praise the name of the LORD.

### 2
Blessed be the name of the LORD both now and forevermore.

### 3
From the rising to the setting of the sun, the name of the LORD is praised.

### 4
The LORD is exalted over all the nations, His glory above the heavens.

### 5
Who is like the LORD our God, the One enthroned on high?

### 6
He humbles Himself to behold the heavens and the earth.

### 7
He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the dump

### 8
to seat them with nobles, with the princes of His people.

### 9
He settles the barren woman in her home, as a joyful mother to her children. Hallelujah!
