### 1
Of David. I will give You thanks with all my heart; before the heavenly beings I will sing Your praises.

### 2
I will bow down toward Your holy temple and give thanks to Your name for Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness; You have exalted Your name and Your word above all else.

### 3
On the day I called, You answered me; You made me bold and strengthened my soul.

### 4
All the kings of the earth will give You thanks, O LORD, when they hear the words of Your mouth.

### 5
They will sing of the ways of the LORD, for the glory of the LORD is great.

### 6
Though the LORD is on high, He attends to the lowly; but the proud He knows from afar.

### 7
If I walk in the midst of trouble, You preserve me from the anger of my foes; You will extend Your hand, and Your right hand will save me.

### 8
The LORD will fulfill His purpose in me. O LORD, Your loving devotion endures forever—do not abandon the works of Your hands.
