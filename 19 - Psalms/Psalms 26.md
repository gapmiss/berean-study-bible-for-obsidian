# Psalms 26

[[Psalms 25]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 27]]

### 1
Of David. Vindicate me, O LORD! For I have walked with integrity; I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.

### 2
Test me, O LORD, and try me; examine my heart and mind.

### 3
For Your loving devotion is before my eyes, and I have walked in Your truth.

### 4
I do not sit with deceitful men, nor keep company with hypocrites.

### 5
I hate the mob of evildoers, and refuse to sit with the wicked.

### 6
I wash my hands in innocence that I may come near Your altar, O LORD,

### 7
to raise my voice in thanksgiving and declare all Your wonderful works.

### 8
O LORD, I love the house where You dwell, the place where Your glory resides.

### 9
Do not take my soul away with sinners, or my life with men of bloodshed,

### 10
in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.

### 11
But I will walk with integrity; redeem me and be merciful to me.

### 12
My feet stand on level ground; in the congregations I will bless the LORD.
