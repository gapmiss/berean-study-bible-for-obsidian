# Psalms 30

[[Psalms 29]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 31]]

### 1
A Psalm. A Song for the dedication of the temple. Of David. I will exalt You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up and have not allowed my foes to rejoice over me.

### 2
O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me.

### 3
O LORD, You pulled me up from Sheol; You spared me from descending into the Pit.

### 4
Sing to the LORD, O you His saints, and give thanks to His holy name.

### 5
For His anger is fleeting, but His favor lasts a lifetime. Weeping may stay the night, but joy comes in the morning.

### 6
In prosperity I said, "I will never be shaken."

### 7
O LORD, You favored me; You made my mountain stand strong. When You hid Your face, I was dismayed.

### 8
To You, O LORD, I called, and I begged my Lord for mercy:

### 9
"What gain is in the shedding of my blood, in my descent to the Pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it proclaim Your faithfulness?

### 10
Hear me, O LORD, and have mercy; O LORD, be my helper."

### 11
You turned my mourning into dancing; You peeled off my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,

### 12
that my heart may sing Your praises and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks forever.
