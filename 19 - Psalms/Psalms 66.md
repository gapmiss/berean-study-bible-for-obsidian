### 1
For the choirmaster. A Song. A Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth!

### 2
Sing the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.

### 3
Say to God, "How awesome are Your deeds! So great is Your power that Your enemies cower before You.

### 4
All the earth bows down to You; they sing praise to You; they sing praise to Your name." Selah

### 5
Come and see the works of God; how awesome are His deeds toward mankind.

### 6
He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the waters on foot; there we rejoiced in Him.

### 7
He rules forever by His power; His eyes watch the nations. Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah

### 8
Praise our God, O peoples; let the sound of His praise be heard.

### 9
He preserves our lives and keeps our feet from slipping.

### 10
For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us like silver.

### 11
You led us into the net; You laid burdens on our backs.

### 12
You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but You brought us into abundance.

### 13
I will enter Your house with burnt offerings; I will fulfill my vows to You—

### 14
the vows that my lips promised and my mouth spoke in my distress.

### 15
I will offer You fatlings as burnt offerings, with the fragrant smoke of rams; I will offer bulls and goats. Selah

### 16
Come and listen, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for me.

### 17
I cried out to Him with my mouth, and His praise was on my tongue.

### 18
If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.

### 19
But God has surely heard; He has attended to the sound of my prayer.

### 20
Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld from me His loving devotion!
