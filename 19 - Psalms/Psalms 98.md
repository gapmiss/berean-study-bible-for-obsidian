### 1
A Psalm. Sing to the LORD a new song, for He has done wonders; His right hand and holy arm have gained Him the victory.

### 2
The LORD has proclaimed His salvation and revealed His righteousness to the nations.

### 3
He has remembered His love and faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

### 4
Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; break forth—let your cry ring out and sing praises!

### 5
Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, in melodious song with the harp.

### 6
With trumpets and the blast of the horn shout for joy before the LORD, the King.

### 7
Let the sea resound, and all that fills it, the world, and all who live in it.

### 8
Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy

### 9
before the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
