# Psalms 130

[[Psalms 129]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 131]]

### 1
A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I cry to You, O LORD!

### 2
O LORD, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to my plea for mercy.

### 3
If You, O LORD, kept track of iniquities, then who, O Lord, could stand?

### 4
But with You there is forgiveness, that You may be feared.

### 5
I wait for the LORD; my soul does wait, and in His word I put my hope.

### 6
My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning—more than watchmen waiting for the morning.

### 7
O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is loving devotion, and with Him is redemption in abundance.

### 8
And He will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
