# Psalms 95

[[Psalms 94]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 96]]

### 1
Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout to the rock of our salvation!

### 2
Let us enter His presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to Him in song.

### 3
For the LORD is a great God, a great King above all gods.

### 4
In His hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to Him.

### 5
The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.

### 6
O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.

### 7
For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep under His care. Today, if you hear His voice,

### 8
do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, in the day at Massah in the wilderness,

### 9
where your fathers tested and tried Me, though they had seen My work.

### 10
For forty years I was angry with that generation, and I said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known My ways."

### 11
So I swore on oath in My anger, "They shall never enter My rest."
