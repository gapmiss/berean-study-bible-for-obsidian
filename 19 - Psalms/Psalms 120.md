# Psalms 120

[[Psalms 119]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 121]]

---

### 1
A Song of Ascents. In my distress I cried to the LORD, and He answered me.

### 2
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips and a deceitful tongue.

### 3
What will He do to you, and what will be added to you, O deceitful tongue?

### 4
Sharp arrows from the warrior, with burning coals of juniper!

### 5
Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar!

### 6
Too long have I dwelt among those who hate peace.

### 7
I am in favor of peace; but when I speak, they want war.
