### 1
A Psalm of Asaph. God presides in the divine assembly; He renders judgment among the gods:

### 2
"How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah

### 3
Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; uphold the rights of the afflicted and oppressed.

### 4
Rescue the weak and needy; save them from the hand of the wicked.

### 5
They do not know or understand; they wander in the darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken."

### 6
I have said, "You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.

### 7
But like mortals you will die, and like rulers you will fall."

### 8
Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are Your inheritance.
