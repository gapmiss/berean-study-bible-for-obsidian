# Psalms 59

[[Psalms 58]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 60]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A Miktam of David, when Saul sent men to watch his house to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise against me.

### 2
Deliver me from workers of iniquity, and save me from men of bloodshed.

### 3
See how they lie in wait for me. Fierce men conspire against me for no transgression or sin of my own, O LORD.

### 4
For no fault of my own, they move swiftly to attack me. Arise to help me, and take notice.

### 5
O LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, rise up to punish all the nations; show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah

### 6
They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.

### 7
See what they spew from their mouths—sharp words from their lips: "For who can hear us?"

### 8
But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations.

### 9
I will keep watch for You, O my strength; for You, O God, are my fortress.

### 10
My God of loving devotion will come to meet me; God will let me stare down my foes.

### 11
Do not kill them, or my people will forget. Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.

### 12
By the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride, in the curses and lies they utter.

### 13
Consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, so it may be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah

### 14
They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.

### 15
They scavenge for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.

### 16
But I will sing of Your strength and proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning. For You are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.

### 17
To You, O my strength, I sing praises, for You, O God, are my fortress, my God of loving devotion.
