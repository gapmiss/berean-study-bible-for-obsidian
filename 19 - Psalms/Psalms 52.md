### 1
For the choirmaster. A Maskil of David. After Doeg the Edomite went to Saul and told him, "David has gone to the house of Ahimelech." Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The loving devotion of God endures all day long.

### 2
Your tongue devises destruction like a sharpened razor, O worker of deceit.

### 3
You love evil more than good, falsehood more than speaking the truth. Selah

### 4
You love every word that devours, O deceitful tongue.

### 5
Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin; He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent; He will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah

### 6
The righteous will see and fear; they will mock the evildoer, saying,

### 7
"Look at the man who did not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his wealth, who strengthened himself by bringing destruction."

### 8
But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in the loving devotion of God forever and ever.

### 9
I will praise You forever, because You have done it. I will wait on Your name—for it is good—in the presence of Your saints.
