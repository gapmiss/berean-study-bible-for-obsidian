# Psalms 142

[[Psalms 141]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 143]]

---

### 1
A Maskil of David, when he was in the cave. A prayer. I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift my voice to the LORD for mercy.

### 2
I pour out my complaint before Him; I reveal my trouble to Him.

### 3
Although my spirit grows faint within me, You know my way. Along the path I travel they have hidden a snare for me.

### 4
Look to my right and see, no one attends to me; there is no refuge for me, no one cares for my soul.

### 5
I cry to You, O LORD: "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."

### 6
Listen to my cry, for I am brought quite low. Rescue me from my pursuers, for they are too strong for me.

### 7
Free my soul from prison that I may praise Your name. The righteous will gather around me because of Your goodness to me.
