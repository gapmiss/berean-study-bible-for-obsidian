# Psalms 11

[[Psalms 10]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 12]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. Of David. In the LORD I take refuge. So how can you say to me, "Flee to your mountain like a bird!

### 2
For behold, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrow on the string to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.

### 3
If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?"

### 4
The LORD is in His holy temple; the LORD is on His heavenly throne. His eyes are watching closely; they examine the sons of men.

### 5
The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked; His soul hates the lover of violence.

### 6
On the wicked He will rain fiery coals and brimstone; a scorching wind will be their portion.

### 7
For the LORD is righteous; He loves justice. The upright will see His face.
