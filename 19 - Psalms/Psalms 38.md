### 1
A Psalm of David, for remembrance. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.

### 2
For Your arrows have pierced me deeply, and Your hand has pressed down on me.

### 3
There is no soundness in my body because of Your anger; there is no rest in my bones because of my sin.

### 4
For my iniquities have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy to bear.

### 5
My wounds are foul and festering because of my sinful folly.

### 6
I am bent and brought low; all day long I go about mourning.

### 7
For my loins are full of burning pain, and no soundness remains in my body.

### 8
I am numb and badly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.

### 9
O Lord, my every desire is before You; my groaning is not hidden from You.

### 10
My heart pounds, my strength fails, and even the light of my eyes has faded.

### 11
My beloved and friends shun my disease, and my kinsmen stand at a distance.

### 12
Those who seek my life lay snares; those who wish me harm speak destruction, and plot deceit all day long.

### 13
But I, like a deaf man, do not hear, and like a mute man, I do not open my mouth.

### 14
I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth offers no reply.

### 15
I wait for You, O LORD; You will answer, O Lord my God.

### 16
For I said, "Let them not gloat over me—those who taunt me when my foot slips."

### 17
For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever with me.

### 18
Yes, I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.

### 19
Many are my enemies without cause, and many hate me without reason.

### 20
Those who repay my good with evil attack me for pursuing the good.

### 21
Do not forsake me, O LORD; be not far from me, O my God.

### 22
Come quickly to help me, O Lord my Savior.
