# Psalms 1

[[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 2]]

---

### 1
Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, or set foot on the path of sinners, or sit in the seat of mockers.

### 2
But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on His law he meditates day and night.

### 3
He is like a tree planted by streams of water, yielding its fruit in season, whose leaf does not wither, and who prospers in all he does.

### 4
Not so the wicked! For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.

### 5
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

### 6
For the LORD guards the path of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
