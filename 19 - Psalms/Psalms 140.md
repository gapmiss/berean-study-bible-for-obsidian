[[Psalms 139]] | [[Psalms]] | [[Psalms 141]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men. Protect me from men of violence,

### 2
who devise evil in their hearts and stir up war all day long.

### 3
They make their tongues as sharp as serpents; the venom of vipers is on their lips. Selah

### 4
Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked. Keep me safe from men of violence who scheme to make me stumble.

### 5
The proud hide a snare for me; the cords of their net are spread along the path, and lures are set out for me. Selah

### 6
I say to the LORD, "You are my God." Hear, O LORD, my cry for help.

### 7
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You shield my head in the day of battle.

### 8
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not promote their evil plans, lest they be exalted. Selah

### 9
May the heads of those who surround me be covered in the trouble their lips have caused.

### 10
May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into the miry pits, never to rise again.

### 11
May no slanderer be established in the land. May calamity hunt down the man of violence.

### 12
I know that the LORD upholds justice for the poor and defends the cause of the needy.

### 13
Surely the righteous will praise Your name; the upright will dwell in Your presence.
