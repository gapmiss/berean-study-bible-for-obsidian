### 1
This is what the LORD says: "For three transgressions of Moab, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.

### 2
So I will send fire against Moab to consume the citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die in tumult, amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet.

### 3
I will cut off the ruler from its midst and kill all the officials with him," says the LORD.

### 4
This is what the LORD says: "For three transgressions of Judah, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they have rejected the law of the LORD and have not kept His statutes; they have been led astray by the lies in which their forefathers walked.

### 5
So I will send fire upon Judah to consume the citadels of Jerusalem."

### 6
This is what the LORD says: "For three transgressions of Israel, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.

### 7
They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the earth; they push the needy out of their way. A man and his father have relations with the same girl and so profane My holy name.

### 8
They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. And in the house of their God, they drink the wine of those who have been fined.

### 9
Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them, though his height was like that of the cedars, and he was as strong as the oaks. Yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.

### 10
And I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.

### 11
I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not true, O children of Israel?" declares the LORD.

### 12
"But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.

### 13
Behold, I am about to crush you in your place as a wagonload of sheaves crushes grain.

### 14
Escape will fail the swift, the strong will not prevail by his strength, and the mighty will not save his life.

### 15
The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet of foot will not escape, and the horseman will not save his life.

### 16
Even the bravest of mighty men will flee naked on that day," declares the LORD.
