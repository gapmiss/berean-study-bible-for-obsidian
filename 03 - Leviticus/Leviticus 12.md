### 1
Then the LORD said to Moses,

### 2
"Say to the Israelites, 'A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be unclean for seven days, as she is during the days of her menstruation.

### 3
And on the eighth day the flesh of the boy's foreskin is to be circumcised.

### 4
The woman shall continue in purification from her bleeding for thirty-three days. She must not touch anything sacred or go into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are complete.

### 5
If, however, she gives birth to a daughter, the woman will be unclean for two weeks as she is during menstruation. Then she must continue in purification from her bleeding for sixty-six days.

### 6
When the days of her purification are complete, whether for a son or daughter, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.

### 7
And the priest will present them before the LORD and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from her flow of blood. This is the law for a woman giving birth, whether to a male or female.

### 8
But if she cannot afford a lamb, she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. Then the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.'"
