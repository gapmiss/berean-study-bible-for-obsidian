### 1
First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered on behalf of all men

### 2
for kings and all those in authority, so that we may lead tranquil and quiet lives in all godliness and dignity.

### 3
This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,

### 4
who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

### 5
For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

### 6
who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right time.

### 7
For this reason I was appointed as a herald, an apostle, and a faithful and true teacher of the Gentiles. I am telling the truth; I am not lying about anything.

### 8
Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or dissension.

### 9
Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves with respectable apparel, with modesty, and with self-control, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,

### 10
but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess to worship God.

### 11
A woman must learn in quietness and full submissiveness.

### 12
I do not permit a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet.

### 13
For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.

### 14
And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression.

### 15
Women, however, will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
