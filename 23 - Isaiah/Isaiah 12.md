[[Isaiah 11]] | [[Isaiah]] | [[Isaiah 13]]

### 1
In that day you will say: "O LORD, I will praise You. Although You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You have comforted me.

### 2
Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. For the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and He also has become my salvation."

### 3
With joy you will draw water from the springs of salvation,

### 4
and on that day you will say: "Give thanks to the LORD; proclaim His name! Make His works known among the peoples; declare that His name is exalted.

### 5
Sing to the LORD, for He has done glorious things. Let this be known in all the earth.

### 6
Cry out and sing, O citizen of Zion, for great among you is the Holy One of Israel."
