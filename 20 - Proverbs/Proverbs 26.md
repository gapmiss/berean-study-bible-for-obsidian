# Proverbs 26

[[Proverbs 25]] | [[Proverbs]] | [[Proverbs 27]]

### 1
Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor does not befit a fool.

### 2
Like a fluttering sparrow or darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.

### 3
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!

### 4
Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be like him.

### 5
Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he become wise in his own eyes.

### 6
Like cutting off one's own feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool.

### 7
Like lame legs hanging limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.

### 8
Like binding a stone into a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.

### 9
Like a thorn that falls into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.

### 10
Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or passer-by.

### 11
As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.

### 12
Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

### 13
The slacker says, "A lion is in the road! A fierce lion roams the public square!"

### 14
As a door turns on its hinges, so the sluggard turns on his bed.

### 15
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.

### 16
The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly.

### 17
Like one who grabs a dog by the ears is a passer-by who meddles in a quarrel not his own.

### 18
Like a madman shooting firebrands and deadly arrows,

### 19
so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "I was only joking!"

### 20
Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, a conflict ceases.

### 21
Like charcoal for embers and wood for fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.

### 22
The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down to the inmost being.

### 23
Like glaze covering an earthen vessel are burning lips and a wicked heart.

### 24
A hateful man disguises himself with his speech, but he lays up deceit in his heart.

### 25
When he speaks graciously, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.

### 26
Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.

### 27
He who digs a pit will fall into it, and whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.

### 28
A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth causes ruin.
